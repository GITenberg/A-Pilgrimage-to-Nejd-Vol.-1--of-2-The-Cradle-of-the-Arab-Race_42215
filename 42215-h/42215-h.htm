<h2><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>PREFACE BY THE EDITOR.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Readers</span> of our last year&rsquo;s
adventures on the Euphrates will hardly need it to be explained
to them why the present journey was undertaken, nor why it stands
described upon our title page as a
&ldquo;Pilgrimage.&rdquo;&nbsp; The journey to Nejd forms the
natural complement of the journey through Mesopotamia and the
Syrian Desert; while Nejd itself, with the romantic interest
attached to its name, seems no unworthy object of a religious
feeling, such as might prompt the visit to a shrine.&nbsp; Nejd,
in the imagination of the Bedouins of the North, is a region of
romance, the cradle of their race, and of those ideas of chivalry
by which they still live.&nbsp; There Antar performed his labours
of Hercules, and Hatim Ta&iuml; the more historical hero
entertained his guests.&nbsp; To the &Aacute;nazeh and Shammar,
especially, whose northward migrations date only from a few
generations back, the tradition of their birth-place is still
almost a recollection; and even to <a name="pagex"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. x</span>the Arabs of the earlier invasions,
the townsmen of such places as Bozra, Palmyra, and Deyr, and to
the Ta&iuml; Bedouins, once lords of Jebel Shammar, it appeals
with a fascination more than equal to that of the Hejaz
itself.&nbsp; Nejd is to all of them what Palestine is to the
Jews, England to the American and Australian colonists; but with
this difference, that they are cut off from the object of their
filial reverence more absolutely in practice than these by an
intervening gulf of desert less hospitable than any sea.&nbsp; It
is rare to meet anywhere in the North an Arab who has crossed the
Great Nef&ucirc;d.</p>
<p>To us too, imbued as we were with the fancies of the Desert,
Nejd had long assumed the romantic colouring of a holy land; and
when it was decided that we were to visit Jebel Shammar, the
metropolis of Bedouin life, our expedition presented itself as an
almost pious undertaking; so that it is hardly an exaggeration,
even now that it is over, and we are once more in Europe, to
speak of it as a pilgrimage.&nbsp; Our pilgrimage then it is,
though the religion in whose name we travelled was only one of
romance.</p>
<p>Its circumstances, in spite of certain disappointments which
the narrative will reveal, were little less romantic than the
idea.&nbsp; Readers who followed our former travels to their
close, may remember a <a name="pagexi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xi</span>certain Mohammed Abdallah, son of the
Sheykh of Palmyra, a young man who, after travelling with us by
order of the Pasha from Deyr to his native town, had at some risk
of official displeasure assisted us in evading the Turkish
authorities, and accomplishing our visit to the
&Aacute;nazeh.&nbsp; It may further be remembered that, in
requital of this service and because we had conceived an
affection for him (for he appeared a really high-minded young
fellow), Mohammed had been given his choice between a round sum
of money, and the honour of becoming &ldquo;the
Beg&rsquo;s&rdquo; brother, a choice which he had chivalrously
decided in favour of the brotherhood.&nbsp; We had then promised
him that, if all went well with us, we would return to Damascus
the following winter, and go in his company to Nejd, where he
believed he had relations, and that we would help him there to a
wife from among his own people.</p>
<p>The idea and the promise were in strict accordance with
Bedouin notions, and greatly delighted both him and his father
Abdallah, to whom they were in due course communicated.&nbsp;
Arab custom is very little changed on the point of marriage from
what it was in the days of Abraham; and it was natural that both
father and son should wish for a wife for him of their own blood,
and that <a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>he should be ready to go far to fetch one.&nbsp;
Moreover, the sort of help we proposed giving (for he could
hardly have travelled to Nejd alone) was just such as beseemed
our new relationship.&nbsp; Assistance in the choice of a wife
ranks in Bedouin eyes with the gift of a mare, or personal aid in
war, both brotherly acts conferring high honour on those
concerned.&nbsp; Mohammed too had a special reason in the
circumstances of his family history to make the proposal doubly
welcome.&nbsp; He found himself in an embarrassing position at
home with regard to marriage, and was in a manner forced to look
elsewhere for a wife.&nbsp; The history of the Ibn Ar&ucirc;ks of
Tudmur, the family to which he belonged, will explain this, and
is so curious, and so typical of Arabia, that it deserves a
passing notice here.</p>
<p>It would appear that seven or eight generations ago (probably
about the date of the foundation of the Wahhabi empire) three
brothers of the noble family of Ar&ucirc;k, Sheykhs of the Beni
Khaled of south-eastern Nejd, quarrelled with their people and
left the tribe.&nbsp; The Ibn Ar&ucirc;ks were then a very
well-known family, exercising suzerain rights over the important
towns of Hasa and Katif, and having independent, even sovereign,
power in their own district.&nbsp; This lay between the Persian
Gulf and Harik, an oasis on the edge of the great southern <a
name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>desert,
and they retained it until they and the rest of their fellow
Sheykhs in Arabia were reduced to insignificance by Mohammed Ibn
Saoud, the first Wahhabi Sultan of Nejd. <a
name="citationxiii"></a><a href="#footnotexiii"
class="citation">[xiii]</a></p>
<p>At the beginning of last century, all Arabia was independent
of central authority, each tribe, and to a certain extent each
town, maintaining its separate existence as a State.&nbsp;
Religion, except in its primitive Bedouin form, had disappeared
from the inland districts, and only the Hejaz and Yemen were more
than nominally Mahometan.&nbsp; The Bedouin element was then
supreme.&nbsp; Each town and village in Arabia was considered the
property of one or other of the nomade Sheykhs in its
neighbourhood, and paid him tribute in return for his
protection.&nbsp; The Sheykh too not unfrequently possessed a
house or castle within the city walls, as a summer residence,
besides his tent outside.&nbsp; He in such cases became more than
a mere suzerain, and exercised active authority over the
townspeople, administering justice at the gate daily, and
enrolling young men as his body-guard, even on occasion levying
taxes.&nbsp; He then received the title of Emir or Prince.&nbsp;
It was in no other way <a name="pagexiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>perhaps that the &ldquo;Shepherd
Kings&rdquo; of Egypt acquired their position and exercised their
power; and vestiges of the old system may still be found in many
parts of Arabia.</p>
<p>In the middle of the eighteenth century, however, Ibn
Abd-el-Wahhab, the Luther of Mahometanism, preached his religious
reform in Nejd, and converted Ibn Saoud, the &Aacute;nazeh Sheykh
of Deriyeh, to his doctrines.&nbsp; By Ibn Abd-el-Wahhab&rsquo;s
help Ibn Saoud, from the mere chief of a tribe, and sovereign of
one city, became Sultan of all Arabia, and reduced one after
another every rival Sheykh to submission.&nbsp; He even
ultimately destroyed the system of tribute and protection, the
original basis of his power, and having raised a regular army
from among the townsmen, made these quite independent of Bedouin
rule.&nbsp; Arabia then, for the first time since Mahomet&rsquo;s
death, became a united empire with a centralised and regular
government.&nbsp; It must have been about the year 1760 that the
three Ibn Ar&ucirc;ks, disgusted with the new state of things in
Nejd, went out to seek their fortunes elsewhere.&nbsp; According
to the tradition, partly embodied in an old ballad which is still
current in Arabia, they were mounted all three upon a single
camel, and had nothing with them but their swords and their high
birth to gain them credit among strangers.&nbsp; They <a
name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>travelled
northwards and at first halted in J&ocirc;f, the northernmost
oasis of Central Arabia, where one of them remained.&nbsp; The
other two, quarrelling, separated; the younger going, tradition
knew not whither, while the elder held on his way still further
north, and settled finally at Tudmur (Palmyra), where he married
a woman of the place, and where he ultimately became
Sheykh.&nbsp; At that time Tudmur consisted but of a few
houses.&nbsp; His name was Ali, and from him our friend Mohammed
and his father Abdallah, and his uncle Faris, the real head of
the family in Tudmur, are descended.</p>
<p>Mohammed then had some reason, as far as his male ancestry
were concerned, to boast of his birth, and look high in making a
&ldquo;matrimonial alliance;&rdquo; but <i>par les femmes</i> he
was of less distinguished blood; and, as purity of descent on
both sides is considered a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i> among the
Arabs, the Ibn Ar&ucirc;ks of Tudmur had not been recognized for
several generations as <i>asil</i>, or noble.&nbsp; They had
married where they could among the townspeople of no birth at
all, or as in the case of Mohammed&rsquo;s father, among the
Mo&aacute;li, a tribe of mixed origin.&nbsp; The &Aacute;nazeh,
in spite of the name of Ar&ucirc;k, would not give their
daughters to them to wife.&nbsp; This was Mohammed&rsquo;s secret
grief, as it had been his father&rsquo;s, and it was as much as
<a name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>anything
else to wipe out the stain in their pedigree, that the son so
readily agreed to our proposal.</p>
<p>The plan of our journey was necessarily vague, as it included
the search after two families of relations of whom nothing had
been heard for nearly a hundred years.&nbsp; The last sign of
life shewn by the Ibn Ar&ucirc;ks of J&ocirc;f had been on the
occasion of Abdallah&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s death by violence,
when suddenly a member of the J&ocirc;f family had appeared at
Tudmur as avenger in the blood feud.&nbsp; This relation had not,
however, stayed longer there than duty required of him, and
having slain his man had as suddenly disappeared.&nbsp; Of the
second family nothing at all was known; and, indeed, to the Ibn
Ar&ucirc;ks as to the other inhabitants of Tudmur, Nejd itself
was now little more than a name, a country known by ancient
tradition to exist, but unvisited by any one then living
connected with the town.</p>
<p>These singular circumstances were, as I have said, the
key-note of our expedition, and will, I hope, lend an interest
beyond that of our own personal adventures to the present
volumes.&nbsp; To Mohammed and the Arabs with whom we travelled,
as well as to most of those we met upon our journey, his family
history formed a perpetual romance, and the <i>kasid</i> or
ballad of Ibn Ar&ucirc;k came in on every occasion, seasonable
and unseasonable, as a chorus to all that <a
name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvii</span>happened.&nbsp; But for it, I doubt whether the
journey could ever have been accomplished; and on more than one
occasion we found ourselves borne easily on by the strength of it
over difficulties which, under ordinary conditions, might have
sufficed to stop us.&nbsp; By extreme good luck, as will be seen
in the sequel, we lit upon both branches of the family we set out
in search of, the one citizens of the J&ocirc;f oasis, the other
Bedouins in Nejd, while the further we got the better was the
Ar&ucirc;k name known, and relations poured in on us on all
sides, eager to shew us hospitality and assistance.&nbsp; We were
thus passed on from kinsman to kinsman, and were everywhere
received as friends; nor is it too much to say that while in
Arabia we enjoyed the singular advantage of being accepted as
members of an Arabian family.&nbsp; This gave us an unique
occasion of seeing, and of understanding what we saw; and we have
only ourselves to blame if we did not turn it to very important
profit.</p>
<p>So much then for the romance.&nbsp; The profit of our
expedition may be briefly summarised.</p>
<p>First as to geography.&nbsp; Though not the only Europeans who
have visited Jebel Shammar, we are the only ones who have done so
openly and at our leisure, provided with compass and barometer
and free to take note of all we saw.&nbsp; Our predecessors, <a
name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>three
in number, Wallin, Guarmani, and Palgrave, travelled in disguise,
and under circumstances unfavourable for geographical
observation.&nbsp; The first, a Finnish professor, proceeded in
1848, as a Mussulman divine, from the coast of the Red Sea to
Ha&iuml;l and thence to the Euphrates.&nbsp; The account of his
journey, given in the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical
Society, is unfortunately meagre, and I understand that, though
one more detailed was published in his own language, he did not
live long enough to record the whole body of his
information.&nbsp; The second, Guarmani, a Levantine of Italian
origin, penetrated in disguise to Jebel Shammar, commissioned by
the French Government to procure them horses from Nejd; and he
communicated a lively and most interesting account of his
adventures to the &ldquo;Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de
G&eacute;ographie&rdquo; in 1865.&nbsp; He too went as a Turkish
mussulman, and, being rather an Oriental than a European,
collected a mass of valuable information relating chiefly to the
Desert Tribes through which he passed.&nbsp; It is difficult,
however, to understand the route maps with which his account is
illustrated, and, though he crossed the Nef&ucirc;d at more than
one point, he is silent as to its singular physical
features.&nbsp;&nbsp; Guarmani started from Jerusalem in 1863 and
visited Teyma, Kheybar, &Aacute;neyzeh, Bereydah, and Ha&iuml;l,
returning thence to <a name="pagexix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xix</span>Syria by J&ocirc;f and the Wady
Sirh&aacute;n.&nbsp; Mr. Palgrave&rsquo;s journey is better
known.&nbsp; A Jesuit missionary and an accomplished Arabic
scholar, he was entrusted with a secret political mission by
Napoleon III. and executed it with the permission of his
superiors.&nbsp; He entered Nejd, disguised as a Syrian merchant,
from Maan, and passing through Ha&iuml;l in 1864 reached Riad,
the capital of the Wahhabi kingdom, and eventually the Persian
Gulf at Katif.&nbsp; His account of Central Arabia is by far the
most complete and life-like that has been published, and in all
matters of town life and manners may be depended upon as
accurate.&nbsp; But his faculty of observation seems chiefly
adapted to a study of society, and the nature he describes is
human nature only.&nbsp; He is too little in sympathy with the
desert to take accurate note of its details, and the
circumstances of his journey precluded him from observing it
geographically.&nbsp; He travelled in the heat of summer and
mostly by night, and was besides in no position, owing to his
assumed character and the doubtful company in which he was often
compelled to travel, to examine at leisure what he saw.&nbsp; Mr.
Palgrave&rsquo;s account of the physical features of the
Nef&ucirc;d, and of Jebel Shammar, the only one hitherto
published, bears very little resemblance to the reality; and our
own <a name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xx</span>observations, taken quietly in the clear atmosphere of
an Arabian winter, are therefore the first of the kind which have
reached Europe.&nbsp; By taking continuous note of the variations
of the barometer while we travelled, we have been able to prove
that the plateau of Ha&iuml;l is nearly twice the height supposed
for it above the sea, while the granite range of Jebel Shammar
exceeds this plateau by about 2000 feet.&nbsp; Again, the great
pilgrim-road from the Euphrates, though well-known by report to
geographers, had never before been travelled by an European, and
on this, as on other parts of our route, we have corrected
previous maps.&nbsp; The map of Northern Arabia appended to the
first volume of our work may be now depended upon as within its
limits substantially accurate.</p>
<p>In geology, though possessing a superficial knowledge only of
our subject, we have, I believe, been able to correct a few
mistakes, and to clear up a doubt, much argued by Professor
Wetzstein, as to the rock formation of Jebel Aja; while a short
memoir I have appended, on the physical conformation of the great
sand desert, will contain original&mdash;possibly
valuable&mdash;matter.&nbsp; The sketches, above all, which
illustrate these volumes, may be relied on as conscientious
representations of the chief physical features of Central
Arabia.</p>
<p><a name="pagexxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxi</span>Botanists and zoologists will be disappointed in the
meagre accounts of plants and animals I am able to give.&nbsp;
But the existence now proved of the white antelope (<i>Oryx
Beatrix</i>) in Nejd is, I believe, a fact new to science, as may
be that of the <i>Webber</i>, a small climbing quadruped allied
to the marmots.</p>
<p>A more important contribution to knowledge will, I hope, be
recognised in a description of the political system to which I
have just alluded under the name of Shepherd rule, and which is
now once more found in Central Arabia.&nbsp; I do not know that
it has ever previously been noticed by writers on Arabia.&nbsp;
Neither Niebuhr nor Burckhardt seem to have come across it in its
pure form, and Mr. Palgrave misunderstood it altogether in his
contempt of Bedouin as contrasted with town life.&nbsp; Yet it is
probably the oldest form of government existing in Arabia, and
the one best suited for the country&rsquo;s needs.&nbsp; In
connection with this matter too, the recent history of Nejd, with
an account of the downfall of the Ibn Saouds, for which I am
mainly indebted to Colonel Ross, British Resident at Bushire, and
the decay of Wahhabism in Arabia, will prove of interest, as may
in a lesser degree the imperfect picture given in the second
volume of the extreme results produced in Persia by despotic
rule, and the iniquitous <a name="pagexxii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxii</span>annexation of Hasa by the
Turks.&nbsp; The value, however, of these
&ldquo;discoveries&rdquo; I leave to our readers to determine,
premising only that they are here pointed out less on account of
their own importance, than as an excuse in matter for the manner
of the narrative.</p>
<p>With regard to the sequel of our Arabian journey, the further
journey from Bagdad to Bushire, I should not intrude it on the
notice of the public, but that it serves as an additional proof,
if such be wanting, of the folly of those schemes which, under
the name of &ldquo;Euphrates Valley&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Indo-Mediterranean&rdquo; railway companies, have from
time to time been dangled before the eyes of speculators.&nbsp; A
country more absolutely unsuited for railway enterprise than that
between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf, has probably
never been selected for such operations; and, if the recital of
our passage through the uninhabited tracts, which form nine
tenths of the whole region, shall deter my countrymen from
embarking their capital in an enterprise financially absurd, I
feel that its publication will not have been in vain.</p>
<p>One word before I end my Preface.&nbsp; It was objected to me
at the Royal Geographical Society&rsquo;s meeting, where I read a
paper on this &ldquo;Visit to Nejd,&rdquo; that though we had
crossed the Great Sand <a name="pagexxiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxiii</span>Desert, and visited Jebel Shammar,
we had after all not been to Nejd.&nbsp; Nejd, I was told on the
&ldquo;best authority,&rdquo; was a term applicable only to that
district of Central Arabia which is bounded by the Jebel Toweykh
and the lesser Nef&ucirc;ds, neither Jebel Shammar nor Kasim
being included in it.&nbsp; Strange as this statement sounded to
ears fresh from the country itself, I was unable at the time to
fortify my refusal to believe by any more special argument than
that the inhabitants of the districts in question had always
called them so,&mdash;an argument &ldquo;quod semper et ab
omnibus&rdquo; which to some seemed insufficient.&nbsp; I have
therefore taken pains to examine the grounds of the objection
raised, and to give a reason for the belief which is still strong
within me that Ha&iuml;l is not only an integral part of Nejd,
but Nejd <i>par excellence</i>.</p>
<p>First then, to repeat the argument &ldquo;quod ab
omnibus,&rdquo; I state emphatically that according to the Arabs
themselves of every tribe and town I have visited, Nejd is held
to include the lands which lie within the Nef&ucirc;ds.&nbsp; It
is a geographical expression including three principal
sub-districts, Jebel Shammar and Kasim in the North, and Aared in
the South.&nbsp; The only doubt I have ever heard expressed was
as to the Nef&ucirc;ds themselves, whether they were included or
not in the term.&nbsp; The <a name="pagexxiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxiv</span>Bedouins certainly so consider
them, for they are the only part of Nejd which they habitually
inhabit, the stony plateaux of the centre being unfit for
pastoral life.&nbsp; J&ocirc;f is considered outside the limit
northwards, as are Kheybar and Teyma to the north-west, while
Jobba and Harik are doubtful, being towns of the Nef&ucirc;d.</p>
<p>Secondly, I plead written authority:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Abulfeda and Edrisi, quoted by Colonel Ross in his
memorandum, include in the term Nejd all those lands lying
between Yemen, Hejaz, and Irak.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Yakut, an Arabian geographer of the thirteenth
century, quoted by Wetzstein, expressly mentions Aja as being in
Nejd.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Merasid confirms Yakut in his geographical
lexicon.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Sheykh Hamid of Kasim, also quoted by Wetzstein,
says, &ldquo;Nejd in its widest sense is the whole of Central
Arabia;&mdash;in its narrowest and according to modern usage,
only the Shammar Mountains and the Land of Kasim, with the Great
Desert bordering it to the South.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Niebuhr, the oldest and most respectable of European
writers, enumerating the towns of Nejd, says, &ldquo;Le mont
Schamer n&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;&agrave; dix journ&eacute;es de
Bagdad; il comprend Ha&iuml;l, Monkek, Kafar, et
Bok&agrave;.&nbsp; L&rsquo;on place <i>aussi</i> dans le Nejdsjed
une contr&eacute;e montagneuse nomm&eacute;e
Djof-al-Sirh&aacute;n entre le mont Sch&acirc;mer et Sh&acirc;m
(la Syrie),&rdquo; etc.; thus <a name="pagexxv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxv</span>showing that all, and more than all
I claim, were in Niebuhr&rsquo;s day accounted Nejd.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Chesney, in his map of Arabia, published in 1838,
includes Kasim and Jebel Shammar within the boundary of Nejd, and
gives a second boundary besides, still further north, including
districts &ldquo;sometimes counted to Nejd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Wallin defines Nejd as the whole district where the
<i>ghada</i> grows, a definition taken doubtless from the
Bedouins with whom he travelled, and which would include not only
Jebel Shammar, but the Nef&ucirc;ds and even the Southern half of
the Wady Sirh&aacute;n.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; In Kazimirski&rsquo;s dictionary, 1860, I find,
&ldquo;<i>Ahlu&rsquo;lghada</i>, surnom donn&eacute; aux
habitants de la fronti&egrave;re de Nejd o&ugrave; la plante
<i>ghada</i> croit en abondance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, Guarmani gives the following as the result of his
inquiries in the country itself: &ldquo;Le Gebel est la province
la plus septentrionale du Neged.&nbsp; C&rsquo;est, comme disent
les Arabes, un des sept Negged;&rdquo; and on the authority of
Zamil, Sheykh of &Aacute;neyzeh, explains these seven to be
Aared, Hasa, and Harik, in the south, Woshem in the centre, and
Jebel Shammar, Kasim, and Sudeyr, in the north.</p>
<p>Opposed to this mass of testimony, we find among travellers a
single competent authority, Mr. Palgrave; and even his opinion is
much qualified.&nbsp; After explaining that the name Nejed
signifies <a name="pagexxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxvi</span>&ldquo;highland,&rdquo; in contradistinction to the
coast and the outlying provinces of lesser elevation, he sums up
his opinion thus: &ldquo;The denomination &lsquo;Nejed&rsquo; is
commonly enough applied to the whole space included between
Djebel Shomer on the north, and the great desert to the south,
from the extreme range of Jebel Toweyk on the east to the
neighbourhood of the Turkish pilgrim-road or Derb-el-Hajj on the
west.&nbsp; However, this central district, forming a huge
parallelogram, placed almost diagonally across the midmost of
Arabia from north-east-by-east to south-west-by-west, as a glance
at the map may show, is again subdivided by the natives of the
country into the Nejed-el-aala or Upper Nejed, and the
Nejed-el-owta or Lower Nejed, a distinction of which more
hereafter, while Djebel Shomer is generally considered as a sort
of appendage to Nejed, rather than as belonging to that district
itself.&nbsp; But the Djowf is always excluded by the Arabs from
the catalogue of upland provinces, though strangers sometimes
admit it also to the title of Nejed, by an error on their part,
since it is a solitary oasis, and a door to highland or inner
Arabia, not in any strict sense a portion of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The exact truth of the matter I take, then, to be this.&nbsp;
Nejd, in its original and popular sense of <a
name="pagexxvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxvii</span>&ldquo;Highlands,&rdquo; was a term of physical
geography, and necessarily embraced Jebel Shammar, the most
elevated district of all, as well as Kasim, which lay between it
and Aared; and so it was doubtless considered in Niebuhr&rsquo;s
time, and is still considered by the Bedouins of the North, whose
recollections date from an age previous to Niebuhr&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
With the foundation, however, of the Wahhabi Empire of Nejd, the
term from a geographical became a political one, and has since
followed the fluctuating fortunes of the Wahhabi State.&nbsp; In
this way it once embraced not only the upland plateaux, but
J&ocirc;f and Hasa; the latter, though a low-lying district on
the coast, retaining in Turkish official nomenclature its
political name of Nejd to the present day.&nbsp; At the time of
Mr. Palgrave&rsquo;s visit, the Wahhabis, from whom doubtless his
information was acquired, considered Jebel Shammar no longer an
integral part of their State, but, as he expresses it, an
appendage.&nbsp; It was already politically independent, and had
ceased in their eyes to be Nejd.&nbsp; But since his day the Nejd
State has seen a still further disruption.&nbsp; Kasim has
regained its independence, and Hasa has been annexed to the
Turkish Empire.&nbsp; Nejd has therefore become once more what it
was before the Empire of Nejd arose, a term of physical geography
only, and one <a name="pagexxviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxviii</span>pretty nearly co-extensive with our term Central
Arabia.</p>
<p>I hold, then, to the correctness of our title, though in this
matter, as in the rest, craving indulgence of the learned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Damascus</span>, <i>Dec.</i> 6,
1878.&mdash;It is strange how gloomy thoughts vanish as one sets
foot in Asia.&nbsp; Only yesterday we were still tossing on the
sea of European thought, with its political anxieties, its social
miseries and its restless aspirations, the heritage of the
unquiet race of Japhet&mdash;and now we seem to have ridden into
still water, where we can rest and forget and be thankful.&nbsp;
The charm of the East is the absence of intellectual life there,
the freedom one&rsquo;s mind gets from anxiety in looking forward
or pain in looking back.&nbsp; Nobody here thinks of the past or
the future, only of the <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>present; and till the day of
one&rsquo;s death comes, I suppose the present will always be
endurable.&nbsp; Then it has done us good to meet old friends,
friends all demonstratively pleased to see us.&nbsp; At the coach
office when we got down, we found a little band of dependants
waiting our arrival&mdash;first of all Mohammed ibn Ar&ucirc;k,
the companion of our last year&rsquo;s adventures, who has come
from Palmyra to meet and travel with us again, and who has been
waiting here for us, it would seem, a month.&nbsp; Then Hanna,
the most courageous of cowards and of cooks, with his ever ready
tears in his eyes and his double row of excellent white teeth,
agrin with welcome.&nbsp; Each of them has brought with him a
friend, a relation he insists on calling him, who is to share the
advantage of being in our service, and to stand by his patron in
case of need, for servants like to travel here in pairs.&nbsp;
Mohammed&rsquo;s <i>cousin</i> is a quiet, respectable looking
man of about five and thirty, rather thick set and very broad
shouldered.&nbsp; He is to act as head camel man, and he looks
just the man for the place.&nbsp; Hanna&rsquo;s <i>brother</i>
bears no likeness at all to Hanna.&nbsp; He is a young giant,
with a rather feckless face, and great splay hands which seem to
embarrass him terribly.&nbsp; He is dressed picturesquely in a
tunic shaped like the ecclesiastical vestment called the
&ldquo;dalmatic,&rdquo; and very probably its origin, with a
coloured turban on his head.&nbsp; He too may be useful, but he
is a Christian, and we rather doubt the prudence of taking
Christian servants to Nejd.&nbsp; Only <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Ferhan, our Agheyl camel-driver, is
missing, and this is a great disappointment, for he was the best
tempered and the most trustworthy of all our followers last
year.&nbsp; I fancy we may search Damascus with a candle before
we find his like again.</p>
<p>The evening we spent in giving and receiving news.&nbsp;
Mohammed in his quality of Wilfrid&rsquo;s &ldquo;brother,&rdquo;
was invited to dine with us, and a very pleasant hour or two we
had, hearing all that has happened in the desert during the
summer.&nbsp; First of all, the sensation that has been caused
there by our purchase of Beteyen&rsquo;s mare, which after all we
have secured, and the heart-burnings and jealousies raised
thereby.&nbsp; Then there have been high doings among our friends
in the Ham&aacute;d.&nbsp; Faris and Jedaan have (wonderful to
relate) made peace, <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> and between them have it all their own
way now on the Euphrates, where the caravan road has become quite
unsafe in consequence.&nbsp; Ferhan ibn Sfuk, it seems, marched
against his brother with some Turkish troops to help him, and
Faris retreated across the river; but most of the Shammar have,
as we anticipated last year, come over to him.&nbsp; The Roala
war is not yet finished.&nbsp; Ibn Shaalan, rejecting the
proposals made him through us by Jedaan, persisted in reoccupying
the Hama pastures last spring, and Jedaan attacked and routed
him; so that he has retreated southwards to his own
country.&nbsp; Mohammed Dukhi and Jedaan have parted company, <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>the Sebaa
having cleared off scores with the Roala, and being satisfied
with the summer&rsquo;s campaign; while the Welled Ali are still
a long way on the creditor side in their blood feud.&nbsp;
Mohammed Dukhi is a long-headed old rogue, but it is difficult to
see how he is to hold his own with Sotamm in spite of a new
alliance with Faris el Meziad, Sheykh of the Mesenneh, who still
has some hundred horsemen to help him with, and of another with
Mohammed Aga of Jer&uacute;d.&nbsp; The Welled Ali are at the
present moment encamped close to Jer&uacute;d, so we shall
probably go there, as the first step on our road to Nejd.</p>
<p>Mohammed of course knows nothing about the roads to Nejd or
J&ocirc;f, except that they are somewhere away to the south, and
that he has relations there, and I doubt if anybody in Damascus
can give us more information.&nbsp; The Welled Ali, however,
would know where the Roala are, and the Roala could send us on,
as they go further south than any of the &Aacute;nazeh.&nbsp; The
difficulty, we fear, this winter will be the accident of no rain
having fallen since last spring, so that the Ham&aacute;d is
quite burnt up and without water.&nbsp; If it were not for this,
our best course would undoubtedly be outside the Hauran, which is
always dangerous, and is said to be especially so this
year.&nbsp; The desert has often been compared to the sea, and is
like it in more ways than one, amongst others in this, that once
well away from shore it is comparatively safe, while there is
always a risk of accidents along the coast.&nbsp; <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>But we shall
see.&nbsp; In the meantime we talk to Mohammed of the J&ocirc;f
only, for fear of scaring him.&nbsp; Nejd, in the imagination of
the northern Arabs, is an immense way off, and no one has ever
been known to go there from Damascus.&nbsp; Mohammed professes
unbounded devotion to Wilfrid, and he really seems to be sincere;
but six hundred miles of desert as the crow flies will be a
severe test of affection.&nbsp; We notice that Mohammed has grown
in dignity and importance since we saw him last, and has adopted
the style and title of Sheykh, at least for the benefit of the
hotel servants; he has indeed good enough manners to pass very
well for a true Bedouin.</p>
<p>There is a small colony of Palmyra people at Damascus, or
rather in the suburb of the town called the Maidan, and with them
Mohammed has been staying.&nbsp; We went there with him this
morning to see some camels he has been buying for us, and which
are standing, or rather sitting, in his friends&rsquo;
yard.&nbsp; The colony consists of two or three families, who
live together in a very poor little house.&nbsp; They left Tudmur
about six years ago &ldquo;in a huff,&rdquo; they say, and have
been waiting on here from day to day ever since to go back.&nbsp;
The men of the house were away from home when we called, for they
make their living like most Tudmuri as carriers; but the women
received us hospitably, asked us to sit down and drink coffee,
excellent coffee, such as we had not tasted for long, and sent <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>a little girl
to bring the camels out of the yard for us to look at.&nbsp; The
child managed these camels just as well as any man could have
done.&nbsp; Mohammed seems to have made a good selection.&nbsp;
There are four deluls for riding, and four big baggage camels;
these last have remarkably ugly heads, but they look strong
enough to carry away the gates of Gaza, or anything else we
choose to put upon their backs.&nbsp; In choosing camels, the
principal points to look at are breadth of chest, depth of
barrel, shortness of leg, and for condition roundness of
flank.&nbsp; I have seen the strength of the hocks tested by a
man standing on them while the camel is kneeling.&nbsp; If it can
rise, notwithstanding the weight, there can be no doubt as to
soundness.&nbsp; One only of the camels did not quite please us,
as there was a suspicion of recent mange; but Abdallah
(Mohammed&rsquo;s cousin) puts it &ldquo;on his head&rdquo; that
all is right with this camel, as with the rest.&nbsp; They are
not an expensive purchase at any rate, as they average less than
&pound;10 a piece.&nbsp; One cannot help pitying them, poor
beasts, when one thinks of the immense journey before them, and
the little probability there is that they will all live to see
the end of it.&nbsp; Fortunately they do not know their fate any
more than we know ours.&nbsp; How wretched we should be for them
if we knew exactly in what wady or at what steep place they would
lie down and be left to die; for such is the fate of
camels.&nbsp; But if we did, we should never have the heart to
set out at all.</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Next in
importance to the camels are the horses we are to ride.&nbsp;
Mohammed has got his little Jilfeh mokhra of last year which is
barely three years old, but he declares she is up to his weight,
thirteen stone, and I suppose he knows best.&nbsp; Mr. S. has
sent us two mares from Aleppo by Hanna, one, a Ras el Fedawi,
very handsome and powerful, the other, a bay three year old
Abeyeh Sherrak, without pretension to good looks, but which ought
to be fast and able to carry a light weight.&nbsp; We rode to the
Maidan, and the chestnut&rsquo;s good looks attracted general
attention.&nbsp; Everybody turned round to look at her; she is
perhaps too handsome for a journey.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 7.&mdash;We have been spending the day with
Mrs. Digby and her husband, Mijuel of the Mizrab, a very well
bred and agreeable man, who has given us a great deal of valuable
advice about our journey.&nbsp; They possess a charming house
outside the town, surrounded by trees and gardens, and standing
in its own garden with narrow streams of running water and paths
with borders full of old fashioned English
flowers&mdash;wall-flowers especially.&nbsp; There are birds and
beasts too; pigeons and turtle doves flutter about among the
trees, and a pelican sits by the fountain in the middle of the
courtyard guarded by a fierce watch-dog.&nbsp; A handsome mare
stands in the stable, but only one, for more are not required in
town.</p>
<p>The main body of the house is quite simple in its <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>bare Arab
furnishing, but a separate building in the garden is fitted up
like an English drawing-room with chairs, sofas, books, and
pictures.&nbsp; Among many interesting and beautiful sketches
kept in a portfolio, I saw some really fine water-colour views of
Palmyra done by Mrs. Digby many years ago when that town was less
known than it is at present.</p>
<p>The Sheykh, as he is commonly called, though incorrectly, for
his elder brother Mohammed is reigning Sheykh of the Mizrab, came
in while we were talking, and our conversation then turned
naturally upon desert matters, which evidently occupy most of his
thoughts, and are of course to us of all-important interest at
this moment.&nbsp; He gave us among other pieces of information
an account of his own tribe, the Mizrab, to which in our
published enumeration of tribes we scarcely did justice.</p>
<p>But before repeating some of the particulars we learned from
him, I cannot forbear saying a few words about Mijuel himself,
which will justify the value we attach to information received
from him as from a person entitled by birth and position to speak
with authority.&nbsp; In appearance he shews all the
characteristics of good Bedouin blood.&nbsp; He is short and
slight in stature, with exceedingly small hands and feet, a dark
olive complexion, beard originally black, but now turning grey,
and dark eyes and eyebrows.&nbsp; It is a mistake to suppose that
true Arabs are ever fair or red-haired.&nbsp; Men may <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>occasionally be
seen in the desert of comparatively fair complexion, but these
<i>always</i> (as far as my experience goes) have features of a
correspondingly foreign type, showing a mixture of race.&nbsp; No
Bedouin of true blood was ever seen with hair or eyes not black,
nor perhaps with a nose not aquiline.</p>
<p>Mijuel&rsquo;s father, a rare exception among the
&Aacute;nazeh, could both read and write, and gave his sons, when
they were boys, a learned man to teach them their letters.&nbsp;
But out of nine brothers, Mijuel alone took any pains to
learn.&nbsp; The strange accident of his marriage with an English
lady has withdrawn him for months at a time, but not estranged
him, from the desert; and he has adopted little of the townsman
in his dress, and nothing of the European.&nbsp; He goes, it is
true, to the neighbouring mosque, and recites the Mussulman
prayers daily; but with this exception, he is undistinguishable
from the Ibn Shaalans and Ibn Mershids of the Ham&aacute;d.&nbsp;
It is also easy to see that his heart remains in the desert, his
love for which is fully shared by the lady he has married; so
that when he succeeds to the Sheykhat, as he probably will, for
his brother appears to be considerably his senior, I think they
will hardly care to spend much of their time at Damascus.&nbsp;
They will, however, no doubt, be influenced by the course of
tribal politics, with which I understand Mijuel is so much
disgusted, that he might resign in favour of his son Afet; in
that case, they might continue, as now, living partly at <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Damascus,
partly at Homs, partly in tents, and always a providence to their
tribe, whom they supply with all the necessaries of Bedouin life,
and guns, revolvers, and ammunition besides.&nbsp; The Mizrab,
therefore, although numbering barely a hundred tents, are always
well mounted and better armed than any of their fellows, and can
hold their own in all the warlike adventures of the Sebaa.</p>
<p>According to Mijuel, the Mizrab, instead of being, as we had
been told, a mere section of the Resallin, are in fact the
original stock, from which not only the Resallin but the
Mo&aacute;hib and the Gomussa themselves have branched off.&nbsp;
In regard to the last-mentioned tribe he related the following
curious story:&mdash;</p>
<p>An Arab of the Mizrab married a young girl of the Suellmat
tribe and soon afterwards died.&nbsp; In a few weeks his widow
married again, taking her new husband from among her own
kinsmen.&nbsp; Before the birth of her first child a dispute
arose as to its parentage, she affirming her Mizrab husband to be
the father while the Suellmat claimed the child.&nbsp; The
matter, as all such matters are in the desert, was referred to
arbitration, and the mother&rsquo;s assertion was put to the test
by a live coal being placed upon her tongue.&nbsp; In spite of
this ordeal she persisted in her statement, and got a judgment in
her favour.&nbsp; Her son, however, is supposed to have been
dissatisfied with the decision, for as soon as born he turned
angrily on his mother, from <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>which circumstance he received the
name of Gomussa or the &ldquo;scratcher.&rdquo;&nbsp; From him
the Gomussa tribe are descended.&nbsp; They first came into
notice about seventy years ago when they attacked and plundered
the Bagdad caravan which happened to be conveying a large sum of
money.&nbsp; With these sudden riches they acquired such
importance that they have since become the leading section of the
tribe, and they are now undoubtedly the possessors of the best
mares among the &Aacute;nazeh.&nbsp; The Mizrab Sheykhs
nevertheless still assert superiority in point of birth, and a
vestige of their old claims still exists in their titular right
to the tribute of Palmyra.</p>
<p>Mijuel&rsquo;s son, Afet, or Japhet, whom we met at
Beteyen&rsquo;s camp last spring, has taken, it would appear, an
active part in the late fighting.&nbsp; During the battle where
Sotamm was defeated by the Sebaa and their allies, the head of
the Ibn Jendal <a name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a> family, pursued by some Welled Ali
horsemen, yielded himself up a prisoner to Afet whose
father-in-law he was, and who sought to give him protection by
covering him with his cloak.&nbsp; But the Ibn Smeyr were at
blood feud with the Ibn Jendals, and in such cases no asylum is
sacred.&nbsp; One of Mohammed Dukhi&rsquo;s sons dragged Ibn
Jendal out of his hiding-place and slew him before Afet&rsquo;s
eyes.&nbsp; On that day the Sebaa took most of the mares and
camels they had lost in the previous <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>fighting, and our friend Ferhan Ibn
Hedeb is now in tolerable comfort again with tents and tent
furniture, and coffee-pots to his heart&rsquo;s content.&nbsp; I
hope he will bear his good fortune as well as he bore the
bad.</p>
<p>Mijuel can of course give us better advice than anybody else
in Damascus, and he says that we cannot do better in the
interests of our journey than go first to Jer&uacute;d and
consult Mohammed Dukhi.&nbsp; The Welled Ali after the Roala are
the tribe which knows the western side of the desert best, and we
should be sure of getting correct information from them, if
nothing more.&nbsp; The Sebaa never go anywhere near the Wady
Sirh&aacute;n, as they keep almost entirely to the eastern half
of the Ham&aacute;d; and even their ghaz&uacute;s hardly ever
meddle with that inhospitable region.&nbsp; Mijuel has once been
as far south as to the edge of the Nef&ucirc;d, which he
describes as being covered with grass in the spring.&nbsp; The
Wady Sirh&aacute;n, he believes, has wells, but no pasturage.</p>
<p>Another interesting visit which we paid while at Damascus was
to Abd el-Kader, the hero of the French war in Algiers.&nbsp;
This charming old man, whose character would do honour to any
nation and any creed, is ending his days as he began them, in
learned retirement and the exercises of his religion.&nbsp; The
Arabs of the west, &ldquo;Maghrabi&rdquo; (Mogrebins), are
distinguished from those of the Peninsula, and indeed from all
others, by a natural taste for piety <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and a religious tone of
thought.&nbsp; Arabia proper, except in the first age of Islam
and latterly during the hundred years of Wahhabi rule, has never
been a religious country.&nbsp; Perhaps out of antagonism to
Persia, its nearest neighbour, it neglects ceremonial observance,
and pays little respect to saints, miracles, and the supernatural
world in general.&nbsp; But with the Moors and the Algerian Arabs
this is different.&nbsp; Their religion is the reason of their
social life and a prime mover in their politics.&nbsp; It is the
fashion there, even at the present day, for a rich man to spend
his money on a mosque, as elsewhere he would spend it on his stud
and the entertainment of guests, and nothing gives such social
distinction as regular attendance at prayer.&nbsp; There is too,
besides the lay nobility, a class of spiritual nobles held
equally high in public estimation.&nbsp; These are the marabous
or descendants of certain saints, who by virtue of their birth
partake in the sanctity of their ancestors and have hereditary
gifts of divination and miraculous cure.&nbsp; They hold indeed
much the same position with the vulgar as did the sons of the
prophets in the days of Saul.</p>
<p>Abd el-Kader was the representative of such a family, and not,
as I think most people suppose, a Bedouin Sheykh.&nbsp; In point
of fact he was a townsman and a priest, not by birth a soldier,
and though trained, as nobles of either class were, to arms, it
was only the accident of a religious war that made him a man of
action.&nbsp; He gained his first <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>victories by his sermons, not by his
sword; and, now that the fight is over, he has returned naturally
to his first profession, that of saint and man of letters.&nbsp;
As such, quite as much as for his military renown, he is revered
in Damascus.</p>
<p>To us, however, it is the extreme simplicity of his character
and the breadth of his good sense, amounting to real wisdom,
which form his principal charm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Saint&rdquo; though
he be &ldquo;by profession,&rdquo; as one may say, for such he is
in his own eyes as well as those of his followers, he is
uninjured by his high position.&nbsp; It is to him an
obligation.&nbsp; His charity is unbounded, and he extends it to
all alike; to be poor or suffering is a sufficient claim on
him.&nbsp; During the Damascus massacres he opened his doors to
every fugitive; his house was crowded with Christians, and he was
ready to defend his guests by force if need were.&nbsp; To us he
was most amiable, and talked long on the subject of Arab
genealogy and tradition.&nbsp; He gave me a book which has been
lately written by one of his sons on the pedigree of the Arabian
horse, and took an evident interest in our own researches in that
direction.&nbsp; He made the pilgrimage to Mecca many years ago,
travelling the whole way from Algeria by land and returning
through Nejd to Meshhed Ali and Bagdad.&nbsp; This was before the
French war.</p>
<p>Abd el-Kader returned our visit most politely next day, and it
was strange to see this old warrior humbly mounted on his little
Syrian donkey, led <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>by a single servant, riding into the garden where we
were.&nbsp; He dresses like a mollah in a cloth gown, and with a
white turban set far back from his forehead after the Algerian
fashion.&nbsp; He never, I believe, wore the Bedouin
kefiyeh.&nbsp; His face is now very pale as becomes a student,
and his smile is that of an old man, but his eye is still bright
and piercing like a falcon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is easy to see,
however, that it will never flash again with anything like
anger.&nbsp; Abd el-Kader has long possessed that highest
philosophy of noble minds according to Arab doctrine,
patience.</p>
<p>A man of a very different sort, but one whom we were also
interested to see, was Midhat Pasha, just arrived at Damascus as
Governor-General of Syria.&nbsp; He had come with a considerable
flourish of trumpets, for he was supposed to represent the
doctrine of administrative reform, which was at that time
seriously believed in by Europeans for the Turkish Empire.&nbsp;
Midhat was the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of our own Foreign Office,
and great things were expected of him.&nbsp; For ourselves,
though quite sceptical on these matters and knowing the history
of Midhat&rsquo;s doings at Bagdad too well to have any faith in
him as a serious reformer, we called to pay our respects, partly
as a matter of duty, and partly it must be owned out of
curiosity.&nbsp; It seemed impossible that a man who had devised
anything so fanciful as parliamentary government for Turkey
should be otherwise than strange and original.&nbsp; But in this
we were grievously <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>disappointed, for a more essentially commonplace, even
silly talker, or one more na&iuml;vely pleased with himself, we
had never met out of Europe.&nbsp; It is possible that he may
have adopted this tone with us as the sort of thing which would
suit English people, but I don&rsquo;t think so.&nbsp; We kept
our own counsel of course about our plans, mentioning only that
we hoped to see Bagdad and Bussora and to go on thence to India,
for such was to be ultimately our route.&nbsp; On the mention of
these two towns he at once began a panegyric of his own
administration there, of the steamers he had established on the
rivers, the walls he had pulled down and tramways built.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, that tramway,&rdquo; he exclaimed
affectionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was I that devised it, and it is
running still.&nbsp; Tramways are the first steps in
civilisation.&nbsp; I shall make a tramway round Damascus.&nbsp;
Everybody will ride in the trucks.&nbsp; It will pay five per
cent.&nbsp; You will go to Bussora.&nbsp; You will see my
steamers there.&nbsp; Bussora, through me, has become an
important place.&nbsp; Steamers and tramways are what we want for
these poor countries.&nbsp; The rivers of Damascus are too small
for steamers, or I should soon have some afloat.&nbsp; But I will
make a tramway.&nbsp; If we could have steamers and tramways
everywhere Turkey would become rich.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And
canals,&rdquo; we suggested, maliciously remembering how he had
flooded Bagdad with his experiments in this way.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, and canals too.&nbsp; Canals, steamers, and tramways,
are what we want.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>railways.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, railways.&nbsp; I
hope to have a railway soon running alongside of the carriage
road from Beyrout.&nbsp; Railways are important for the
guaranteeing of order in the country.&nbsp; If there was a
railway across the desert we should have no more trouble with the
Bedouins.&nbsp; Ah, those poor Bedouins, how I trounced them at
Bagdad.&nbsp; I warrant my name is not forgotten
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; We assured him it was not.</p>
<p>He then went on to talk of the Circassians, &ldquo;<i>ces
pauvres Circassiens</i>,&rdquo; for he was speaking in French,
&ldquo;<i>il faut que je fasse quelque chose pour
eux</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wish I could give some idea of the tone
of tenderness and almost tearful pity in Midhat&rsquo;s voice as
he pronounced this sentence; the Circassians seemed to be dearer
to him than even his steamers and tramways.&nbsp; These
unfortunate refugees are, in truth, a problem not easy of
solution: they have been a terrible trouble to Turkey, and, since
they were originally deported from Russia after the Crimean war,
they have been passed on from province to province until they can
be passed no further.&nbsp; They are a scourge to the inhabitants
wherever they go, because they are hungry and armed, and insist
on robbing to get a livelihood.&nbsp; To the Syrian Arabs they
are especially obnoxious, because they shed blood as well as rob,
which is altogether contrary to Arab ideas.&nbsp; The Circassians
are like the foxes which sportsmen turn out in their
covers.&nbsp; It is a public-spirited act to have done so, but
they cannot <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>be made to live in peace with the hares and
rabbits.&nbsp; Midhat, however, had a notable scheme for setting
things to rights.&nbsp; He would draft all these men into the
corps of zaptiehs, and then, if they did rob, it would be in the
interests of Government.&nbsp; Some score of them were waiting in
the courtyard at the time of our visit, to be experimented on;
and a more evil-visaged set it would have been difficult to
select.</p>
<p>On the whole, we went away much impressed with Midhat, though
not as we had hoped.&nbsp; He had astonished us, but not as a
wise man.&nbsp; To speak seriously, one such reforming pasha as
this does more to ruin Turkey than twenty of the old dishonest
sort.&nbsp; Midhat, though he fails to line his own purse, may be
counted on to empty the public one at Damascus, as he did at
Bagdad, where he spent a million sterling on unproductive works
within a single year.&nbsp; As we wished him good-bye, we were
amused to notice that he retained Mr. Siouffi, the manager of the
Ottoman Bank, who had come with us, with him for a private
conference, the upshot of which was his first public act as
Governor of Syria, the raising of a loan. <a

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> spent a week at Damascus, a week
not altogether of pleasure, although it was to be our last of
civilised life.&nbsp; We had an immense number of things to buy
and arrange and think over, before starting on so serious a
journey as this, which we knew must be very unlike the pleasure
trip of last year.&nbsp; We could not afford to leave anything to
chance with the prospect of a three months&rsquo; wandering, and
a thousand miles of desert, where it was impossible to count upon
fresh supplies even of the commonest necessaries of life.&nbsp;
J&ocirc;f, the first station on our road, was four hundred miles
off, and then we must cross the Nef&ucirc;d, with its two hundred
miles of sand, before we could get to Nejd.&nbsp; The return
journey, too, to the Persian Gulf, would have to be made without
coming to anything so European as a Turkish town.&nbsp; Nobody
could tell us what supplies were to be had in Nejd, beyond dates
and corn.&nbsp; Mr. Palgrave&rsquo;s account of Jebel <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Shammar was,
in fact, the only guide we had to go on, and its accuracy had
been so much doubted that we felt obliged to take into
consideration the possibility of finding the Nejd towns mere
oases, and their cultivation only that of the date.</p>
<p>Mohammed, less &ldquo;insouciant&rdquo; than most of his
countrymen are on such matters, now made himself most useful,
spending many hours in the bazaars with Wilfrid, as I did with
the cook and the camel-man; and being a town Arab and a trader
born, he saved us an infinity of trouble and time, and no few
mejidies.</p>
<p>They began by choosing a complete suit of Bedouin clothes for
Wilfrid, not exactly as a disguise, for we did not wish, even if
we could have done so, not to pass for Europeans, but in order to
avoid attracting more notice than was necessary on our way.&nbsp;
The costume consisted of a striped silk jibbeh or dressing-gown
worn over a long shirt, a blue and white abba of the kind made at
Karieteyn, and for the head a black kefiyeh embroidered with gold
which was fastened on with the Bedouin aghal, a black
lamb&rsquo;s-wool rope.&nbsp; Mohammed had brought with him a
sword which had belonged to his grandfather, a fine old Persian
blade curved like a sickle.&nbsp; He gave it to Wilfrid and
received in return a handsome weapon somewhat similar but
silver-mounted, which they found in the bazaar.&nbsp; Thus rigged
out, for Mohammed too had been reclothed from head to foot (and
he much required it), they used to sally <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>out in the
town as two Bedouin gentlemen.&nbsp; Wilfrid by holding his peace
was able to pass with the unwary as an unconcerned friend, while
Mohammed did the bargaining for cloaks, kefiyehs, and other
articles suitable as presents to the Sheykhs whose acquaintance
we might make.&nbsp; Mohammed was an expert in driving a hard
bargain and knew the exact fashion in vogue in each Bedouin
tribe, so that although his taste did not always quite agree with
ours, we let him have his way.&nbsp; The only mistake he made, as
it turned out, was in underestimating the value of gifts
necessary in Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; Not one of us had the least idea of
the luxury existing in Nejd, and Mohammed, like most of the
northern Arabs, had heard of Ibn Rashid only as a Bedouin Sheykh,
and fancied that a red cloth jibbeh would be the <i>ne plus
ultra</i> of magnificence for him, as indeed it would have been
for an Ibn Shaalan or an Ibn Mershid.&nbsp; We had, however, some
more serious presents than these to produce, if necessary, in the
rifles and revolvers we carried with us, so that we felt there
was no real danger of arriving empty-handed.</p>
<p>The purchases which it fell to my share to make, with the
assistance of Abdallah and the cook, were entirely of a useful
sort, and do not require a detailed description here.&nbsp; As to
dress, it was unnecessary for me to make any change, save that of
substituting a kefiyeh for a hat and wearing a Bedouin cloak over
my ordinary travelling ulster.&nbsp; <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Hanna and Abdallah were both of them
masters in the art of haggling, and vied with each other in
beating down the prices of provisions.&nbsp; Dates, flour,
burghul (a kind of crushed wheat, which in Syria takes the place
of rice), carrots, onions, coffee, and some dried fruit were to
be the mainstay of our cooking, and of these we bought a supply
sufficient to last us as far as J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; We had brought
from England some beef tea, vegetable soup squares, and a small
quantity of tea in case of need.&nbsp; We had agreed to do
without bulky preserved provisions, which add greatly to the
weight of baggage, and that as to meat, we would take our chance
of an occasional hare or gazelle, or perhaps now and then a
sheep.</p>
<p>All began well.&nbsp; Our servants seemed likely to turn out
treasures, and we had no difficulty in getting a couple of
Agheyls to start with us as camel drivers.&nbsp; We thought it
prudent to keep our own counsel as to the direction we intended
to take, and it was generally supposed that Bagdad was to be our
first object.&nbsp; Only Mohammed and Hanna were informed of the
real design, and them we could trust.&nbsp; Not but what Hanna
had occasional fits of despondency about the risk he ran.&nbsp;
He did not pretend to be a hero, he had a wife and children to
whom he was sincerely attached, and he felt, not quite wrongly,
that Central Arabia was hardly the place for one of his nation
and creed.&nbsp; He came to us, indeed, one morning, to announce
<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>his
intention of returning home to Aleppo, and he required a good
deal of humouring before he recovered his spirits; but I do not
think that he ever seriously intended to desert us.&nbsp; He had
come all the way from Aleppo to join us, and, besides, the
companionship of the young giant he called his
&ldquo;brother,&rdquo; who was to share his tent, reassured
him.&nbsp; Once started, we knew that he would bear patiently all
that fortune might inflict.</p>
<p>By the 11th the necessary preparations had been made, and we
were ready to start.&nbsp; As a preliminary, we moved into a
garden outside the town with our camels and our mares, so as to
be at liberty to go off any morning without attracting notice and
in the direction we might choose.&nbsp; It was generally believed
in Damascus that we intended going to Bagdad, and we had made up
our minds to start in that direction, partly to avoid questions,
and partly because at Jer&uacute;d, the first village on the road
to Palmyra, we should find Mohammed Dukhi with the Welled
Ali.&nbsp; He seemed the most likely person to put us on our way,
and in expeditions of this sort the first few marches are
generally the most difficult, if not the most dangerous.&nbsp;
The edges of the desert are always unsafe, whereas, once clear of
the shore, so to speak, there is comparatively little risk of
meeting anybody, friend or foe.&nbsp; We thought then that we
should be able to get a man from Mohammed Dukhi to take us in a
straight line from Jer&uacute;d to some point in the Wady
Sirh&aacute;n, <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>keeping well outside the Hauran, a district of the worst
reputation, and following perhaps a line of pools or wells which
the Bedouins might know.&nbsp; But just as we had settled this,
Mohammed Dukhi himself appeared unexpectedly at Damascus, and our
plan was changed.</p>
<p>Mohammed Dukhi ibn Smeyr is the greatest personage in the
north-western desert next to Ibn Shaalan, and as I have said
before was at that time hotly engaged in a war with the Roala
chief.&nbsp; His object in visiting Damascus was as follows: in
the course of the autumn a detachment of fifteen Turkish soldiers
attacked his camp without provocation and, firing into it, killed
a woman and a child.&nbsp; This camp numbered only a few tents,
the tribe being at the time scattered on account of pasturage,
and the Sheykh himself was absent with most of the men.&nbsp;
Those, however, who had remained at home managed to cut off and
surround the soldiers, one of whom was killed in the fray.&nbsp;
The Welled Ali would have killed the rest but for Mohammed
Dukhi&rsquo;s wife, Herba, <a name="citation26"></a><a
href="#footnote26" class="citation">[26]</a> who rushed in among
the combatants, and remonstrated with her people on the folly of
involving themselves in a quarrel with the Government.&nbsp; Her
pluck saved the soldiers&rsquo; lives.&nbsp; She took them under
her protection, and the next morning sent them under escort to a
place of safety.</p>
<p>Now Mohammed Dukhi, having the Roala war <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>on his hands
and being obliged to shelter himself from Ibn Shaalan under the
walls of Jer&uacute;d, was naturally anxious to clear up this
matter of the soldier&rsquo;s death; and, directly he heard of
Midhat&rsquo;s arrival at Damascus, he shrewdly determined to
make his count with the new Pasha by an early call at the
Serai.&nbsp; Ibn Shaalan was out of the way, and the first comer
would doubtless be the one most readily listened to.&nbsp; Ibn
Smeyr had besides a little intrigue on foot respecting the escort
of the Damascus pilgrims, which he in part provided or hoped to
provide.&nbsp; Abd el-Kader was his friend, and it was at the
Emir&rsquo;s house that he alighted and that we found him.&nbsp;
Mohammed Dukhi, noble though he is in point of blood, is not a
fine specimen of a great Bedouin Sheykh.&nbsp; His politeness is
overstrained and unnatural, reminding one rather of city than of
desert manners; there are also ugly stories of his want of faith,
which one finds no difficulty in believing when one sees
him.&nbsp; He affected, however, great pleasure at seeing us
again, and professed an entire devotion to our welfare and our
plans.&nbsp; He would himself accompany us on the first stages of
our road, or at least send his sons or some of his men; offers
which dwindled, till at last they resulted in his merely writing
some letters of recommendation for us, and giving us a large
amount of good advice.&nbsp; As regards the latter, he informed
us that a journey such as we proposed outside the Hauran would
not at the present <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>moment be practicable.&nbsp; No rain had fallen during
the autumn, and the Ham&aacute;d was without water; indeed,
except in the Wady Sirh&aacute;n, where the wells were never dry,
there was no watering place southwards at any distance from the
hills.&nbsp; He advised us, therefore, to leave Damascus by the
pilgrim road, which keeps inside the Hauran, and follow it till
we came across the Beni Sokkhr, whom we should find encamped not
far to the east of it.&nbsp; There was besides a capital
opportunity for us of doing this in company with the
<i>Jerdeh</i>, now on the point of starting for Mez&aacute;rib, a
station on the Haj road.&nbsp; The Jerdeh, he explained, for the
name was new to us, are a kind of relief party sent every year
from Damascus, to meet the pilgrims on their homeward route,
carrying with them supplies of all the necessaries of life,
provisions, and extra camels to replace those broken down.&nbsp;
The party is escorted by Mohammed Dukhi, or rather by his men,
and the idea of joining them seemed exactly suited to our
purpose; though when we came to put it in practice, it turned out
to be of as little value as the rest of the smooth-spoken
Sheykh&rsquo;s offers.&nbsp; It was something, however, to have a
plan, good or bad, and letters from so great a man as Ibn Smeyr
were of value, even though addressed to the wrong people.</p>
<p>Accordingly, on the 12th we bade good-bye to our Damascus
friends, wrote our last letters to our friends in England, and
said a long farewell to <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the pleasures and pains of European
life.&nbsp; On the 13th we started.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 13.&mdash;We have started at last, and on a
Friday, the 13th of the month.&nbsp; I have no personal objection
to any particular day of the week, or of the month.&nbsp; But, as
a matter of fact, the only seriously unfortunate journey we ever
made was begun on a Friday, and Wilfrid professes himself to be
superstitious and full of dark foreboding.&nbsp; He, however,
insisted on starting this Friday, and with some inconsistency
argues that forebodings are lucky, or that at any rate the
absence of them is unlucky, and that it would not be safe to
begin a journey in a cheerful frame of mind.</p>
<p>We were roused in the middle of the night by a cry of thieves
in the garden, and running out of our tent found a scuffle going
on, which, when lights were brought, proved to have been caused
by two men, one the keeper of the garden and the other a soldier,
whom he was taking prisoner.&nbsp; Our servants were standing
round them, and Hanna, seeing the man to be securely bound, was
belabouring him with a stick, ejaculating at intervals, &ldquo;O
robber, O dog, O pig!&nbsp; O pig, O dog, O robber!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The story told us was that the gardener had found this man
prowling about, and had, after a terrible engagement, succeeded
in his capture.&nbsp; There were, however, no blood or wounds to
show; and, the evidence of the prisoner&rsquo;s wicked designs
not being <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>very overwhelming, Wilfrid gave orders that he should be
let go as soon as it should be daylight.&nbsp; In the first
place, any handing over of the man to justice would have delayed
our start, and secondly, it was more than probable that the whole
thing had been got up by the gardener with the accused person for
the sake of the present the two would receive.&nbsp; Such little
comedies are quite common in the East; and when we declined to
take it seriously, the two men very good-humouredly let the
matter drop.</p>
<p>At the first streak of dawn we struck our tents, loaded our
camels, and a little after sunrise were on our mares and well
away from the town in marching order for Nejd!&nbsp; At first we
skirted the city, passing the gate where St. Paul is said to have
entered, and the place where he got over the wall, and then along
the suburb of Maidan, which is the quarter occupied by Bedouins
when they come to town, and where we had found the Tudmuri and
our camels.&nbsp; Here we were to have met the Jerdeh, and we
waited some time outside the Baw&aacute;bat Allah, or
&ldquo;Gates of God,&rdquo; while Mohammed went in to make
inquiries, and take leave of his Tudmuri friends.&nbsp; It is in
front of this gate that the pilgrims assemble on the day of their
start for Mecca, and from it the Haj road leads away in a nearly
straight line southwards.&nbsp; The Haj road is to be our route
as far as Mez&aacute;rib, and is a broad, well worn track, though
of course not a road at all according to English ideas.&nbsp; It
has, nevertheless, <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>a sort of romantic interest, one cannot help feeling,
going as it does so far and through such desolate lands, a track
so many thousand travellers have followed never to return.&nbsp;
I suppose in its long history a grave may have been dug for every
yard of its course from Damascus to Medina, for, especially on
the return journey, there are constantly deaths among the
pilgrims from weariness and insufficient food.</p>
<p>Our caravan, waiting at the gate, presented a very picturesque
appearance.&nbsp; Each of the del&uacute;ls carries a gay pair of
saddle-bags in carpet-work, with long worsted tassels hanging
down on each side half way to the ground; and they have
ornamented <i>reshmehs</i> or headstalls to match.&nbsp; The
camels, too, though less decorated, have a gay look; and Wilfrid
on the chestnut mare ridden in a halter wants nothing but a long
lance to make him a complete Bedouin.&nbsp; The rest of our party
consists, besides Mohammed and Hanna, who have each of them a
del&uacute;l to ride, of Mohammed&rsquo;s &ldquo;cousin&rdquo;
Abdallah, whom we call Sheykh of the camels, with his two Agheyl
assistants, Awwad, a negro, and a nice-looking boy named Abd
er-Rahman.&nbsp; These, with Mohammed, occupy one of the
servants&rsquo; tents, while Hanna and his &ldquo;brother&rdquo;
Ibrahim have another, for even in the desert distinctions of
religious caste will have to be preserved.&nbsp; It is a great
advantage in travelling that the servants should be as much as
possible strangers to each other, and of <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>different
race or creed, as this prevents any combination among them for
mutiny or disobedience.&nbsp; The Agheyls will be one clique, the
Tudmuri another, and the Christians a third, so that though they
may quarrel with one another, they are never likely to unite
against us.&nbsp; Not that there is any prospect of difficulty
from such a cause; but three months is a long period for a
journey, and everything must be thought of beforehand.</p>
<p>Mohammed was not long in the Maidan, and came back with the
news that the Jerdeh has not been seen there, but might be at a
khan some miles on the road called Khan Den&uacute;n.&nbsp; It
was useless to wait for them there, and so, wishing our friend,
Mr. Siouffi, good-bye (for he had accompanied us thus far) we
rode on.&nbsp; Nothing remarkable has marked our first
day&rsquo;s journey; a gazelle crossing the track, and a rather
curious squabble between a kite, a buzzard, and a raven, in which
the raven got all the profit, being the only events.&nbsp; From
the crest of a low ridge we looked back and saw our last of
Damascus, with its minarets and houses imbedded in green.&nbsp;
We shall see no more buildings, I suppose, for many a day.&nbsp;
Mount Hermon to the left of it rose, an imposing mass, hazy in
the hot sun, for, December though it is, the summer is far from
over.&nbsp; Indeed, we have suffered from the heat today more
than we did during the whole of our last journey.</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>At
Den&uacute;n no sign or knowledge of the Jerdeh, so we have
decided to do without them.&nbsp; On a road like this we cannot
want an escort.&nbsp; There are plenty of people passing all day
long, most of them, like ourselves, going to Mez&aacute;rib for
the annual fair which takes place there on the occasion of the
Jerdeh visit.&nbsp; Among them, too, are zaptiehs and even
soldiers; and there are to be several villages on the way.&nbsp;
We filled our goat-skins at Den&uacute;n and camped for this our
first night on some rising ground looking towards Hermon.&nbsp;
It is a still, delightful evening, but there is no moon.&nbsp;
The sun is setting at five o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 14.&mdash;Still on the Haj road and through
cultivated land, very rich for wheat or barley, Mohammed says,
though it has a fine covering of stones.&nbsp; These are black
and volcanic, very shiny and smooth, just as they were shot up
from the Hauran when the Hauran was a volcano.&nbsp; The soil
looks as if it ought to grow splendid grapes, and some say the
bunches the spies brought to Joshua came from near here.&nbsp;
The villages, of which we have passed through several, are black
and shiny too, dreary looking places even in the sunshine,
without trees or anything pleasant to look at round them.&nbsp;
The fields at this time of year are of course bare of crops, and
it is so long since there was any rain that even the weeds are
gone.&nbsp; This is part of what is called the Leja, a district
entirely of black boulders, and interesting to
arch&aelig;ologists as being <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>the land of Og, king of Basan, whose
cities some have supposed to exist in ruins to the present
day.</p>
<p>In the middle of the day we passed a small ruin, about which
Mohammed, who has been this road before, as his father was at one
time camel-contractor for the Haj, told us a curious story.&nbsp;
Once upon a time there were two children, left orphans at a very
early age.&nbsp; The elder, a boy, went out into the world to
seek his fortune, while the other, a girl, was brought up by a
charitable family in Damascus.&nbsp; In course of time the
brother and sister came together by accident, and, without
knowing their relationship, married, for according to eastern
usage the marriage had been arranged for them by others.&nbsp;
Then, on comparing notes, they discovered the mistake which had
been made; and the young man, anxious to atone for the guilt they
had inadvertently incurred, consulted a wise man as to what he
should do in penance.&nbsp; He was told to make the pilgrimage to
Mecca seven times, and then to live seven years more in some
desert place on the Haj road offering water to the
pilgrims.&nbsp; This he did, and chose the place we passed for
the latter part of his penance.&nbsp; When the seven years were
over, however, he returned to Damascus, and the little house he
had built and the fig-trees he had planted remain as a record of
his story.&nbsp; Mohammed could not tell me what became of the
girl, and seemed to think it did not matter.</p>
<p>He has been talking a great deal to us on the duties <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>of
brotherhood, which seemed a little like a suggestion.&nbsp; The
rich brother, it would seem, should make the poor one presents,
not only of fine clothes, but of a fine mare, a fine
del&uacute;l, or a score of sheep,&mdash;while the poor brother
should be very careful to protect the life of his sworn ally, or,
if need be, to avenge his death.&nbsp; Wilfrid asked him how he
should set about this last, if the case occurred.&nbsp;
&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; said Mohammed, &ldquo;I should
inquire who the shedder of blood was.&nbsp; I should hear, for
instance, that you had been travelling in the Hauran and had been
killed, but I should not know by whom.&nbsp; I should then leave
Tudmur, and, taking a couple of camels so as to seem to be on
business, should go to the place where you had died, under a
feigned name, and should pretend to wish to buy corn of the
nearest villagers.&nbsp; I should make acquaintance with the old
women, who are always the greatest talkers, and should sooner or
later hear all about it.&nbsp; Then, when I had found out the
real person, I should watch carefully all his goings out and
comings in, and should choose a good opportunity of taking him
unawares, and run my sword through him.&nbsp; Then I should go
back to Tudmur as fast as my del&uacute;l could carry
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wilfrid objected that in England we thought it
more honourable to give an enemy the chance of defending himself;
but Mohammed would not hear of this.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would not be
right.&nbsp; My duty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would be to avenge
your blood, not to fight with the man; and if I got the <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>opportunity,
I should come upon him asleep or unarmed.&nbsp; If he was some
poor wretch, of no consequence, I should take one of his
relations instead, if possible the head of his family.&nbsp; I
cannot approve of your way of doing these things.&nbsp; Ours is
the best.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mohammed might have reasoned (only Arabs
never reason), that there were others besides himself concerned
in the deed being secretly and certainly done.&nbsp; An avenger
of blood carries not only his own life but the lives of his
family in his hand; and if he bungles over his vengeance, and
himself gets killed, he entails on them a further debt of
blood.&nbsp; To Mohammed, however, on such a point, reasoning was
unnecessary.&nbsp; What he had described was the custom, and that
was enough.</p>
<p>We are now a little to the south of the village of Gunayeh
where we have sent Abdallah with a del&uacute;l to buy
straw.&nbsp; There is no camel pasture here nor anything the
horses can eat.&nbsp; To the east we can see the blue line of the
Hauran range, and to the west the Syrian hills from Hermon to
Ajalon.&nbsp; I told Mohammed the story of the sun standing still
over Gibeon and the moon over Ajalon, which he took quite as a
matter of course, merely mentioning that he had never heard it
before.</p>
<p>I forgot to say that we crossed the old Roman road several
times to-day.&nbsp; It is in fair preservation, but the modern
caravan track avoids it.&nbsp; Perhaps in old days wheeled
carriages were common and required a stone road.&nbsp; Now there
is no such <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>necessity.&nbsp; At Ghabaghat, a village we passed about
eleven o&rsquo;clock, we found a tank supplied with water from a
spring, and while we were waiting there watering the camels a fox
ran by pursued by two greyhounds, who soon came up with and
killed him.&nbsp; One of the dogs, a blue or silver grey, was
very handsome and we tried to buy him of his owner, a soldier,
but he would not take the money.&nbsp; After that we had a bit of
a gallop in which we were pleased with our new mares.&nbsp; But
we are both tired with even this short gallop, being as yet not
in training, and we feel the heat of the sun.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, <i>December</i> 15.&mdash;We have left the Leja
country and are now in bare open fields, a fine district for
farmers, but as uninteresting as the plains of Germany or
northern France.&nbsp; These fields are better watered than the
Leja, and we crossed several streams to-day by old stone bridges
belonging to the Roman road.&nbsp; The streams run, I believe,
eventually into the Jordan, and in one place form a marsh to the
right of the road which Mohammed declared to be infested by
robbers, men who lurk about in the tall reeds and when they have
made a capture run off with their booty into it and cannot be
followed.&nbsp; We saw nothing suspicious, however, nor anything
of interest but a huge flock of sand grouse, of which we got four
as they passed overhead.&nbsp; There were also immense clouds of
starlings, and we started a hare.&nbsp; We passed many villages,
the principal one being Shemskin, where <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>there are the
ruins of an old town.&nbsp; Our road then bore away to the right,
leaving the Roman road for good.&nbsp; This goes on straight to
Bozra, the chief town of the Hauran in former days.</p>
<p>At Tafazz we stopped to pay a visit to some Tudmuri settled
there, relations of Mohammed&rsquo;s but not on the Ibn
Ar&ucirc;k side, very worthy people though hardly respectable as
relations.&nbsp; Tafazz from the outside looks like a heap of
ruins half smothered in dunghills.&nbsp; There has been a murrain
among the cattle this year, and dead cows lay about in every
stage of decomposition.&nbsp; We had some difficulty in groping
our way through them to the wretched little mud hovel where the
Tudmuri lived.&nbsp; The family consisted of two middle-aged men,
brothers, with their mother, their wives, and a pretty daughter
named Shemseh (sunshine), some children, and an old man, uncle or
grandfather of the others.&nbsp; These were all presently
clustering round us, and hugging and kissing Mohammed who, I must
say, showed a complete absence of false pride in spite of his
fine clothes and noble appearance.&nbsp; Their welcome to us,
poor people, was very hearty; and in a few minutes coffee was
being pounded, and a breakfast of unleavened loaves, thin and
good, an omelette, buttermilk (lebben), and a sweet kind of
treacle (dibs), made of raisins, prepared.&nbsp; While we were at
breakfast a little starved colt looked in at the door from the
yard; and some chickens and a <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>pretty fawn greyhound, all equally
hungry I thought, watched us eagerly.&nbsp; The people were very
doleful about the want of rain, and the loss of their yoke-oxen,
which makes their next year&rsquo;s prospects gloomily
uncertain.&nbsp; They told us, however, that they had a good
stock of wheat in their underground granaries, sufficient for a
year or even more, which shows a greater amount of forethought
than I should have expected of them.&nbsp; In these countries it
is quite necessary to provide against the famines which happen
every few years, and in ancient times I believe it was a
universal practice to keep a year&rsquo;s harvest in store.</p>
<p>After many entreaties that we would stay the night under their
roof they at last suffered us to depart, promising that the men
of the party would rejoin us the following day at Mez&aacute;rib,
for Mez&aacute;rib was close by.&nbsp; There we arrived about
three o&rsquo;clock and are encamped on the piece of desert
ground where the fair is held.&nbsp; The view from our tents is
extremely pretty, a fine range of distant hills, the Ajlun to the
south-west, and about a mile off a little lake looking very blue
and bright, with a rather handsome ruined khan or castle in the
foreground.&nbsp; To the left the tents of the Suk, mostly white
and of the Turkish pattern.&nbsp; There are about a hundred and
fifty of them in four rows, making a kind of street.&nbsp; The
village of Mez&aacute;rib stands on an island in the lake,
connected by a stone causeway with the shore, but the Suk is on
the <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>mainland.&nbsp; There is a great concourse of people
with horses, and donkeys, and camels, and more are constantly
coming from each quarter of the compass.&nbsp; They have not as
yet paid much attention to us, so that we have been able to make
ourselves comfortable.&nbsp; There is a fresh wind blowing from
the south, and there is a look in the clouds of something like
rain.&nbsp; I have never before wished for rain on a journey, but
I do so heartily now; these poor people want it badly.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 16.&mdash;To-day we have done nothing but
receive visits.&nbsp; First there came a Haurani, who announced
himself as a sheykh, and gave us the information that Sotamm ibn
Shaalan and the Roala are somewhere near Ezrak.&nbsp; If this be
true it will be a great piece of good luck for us, but other
accounts have made it doubtful.&nbsp; A more interesting visitor
was a young man, a native of Bereydeh in Nejd, who, hearing that
we were on our way to J&ocirc;f, came to make friends with
us.&nbsp; Though a well-mannered youth, he is evidently nothing
particular in the way of position at home, and admits having been
somebody&rsquo;s servant at Bagdad, but on the strength of a
supposed descent from the Beni Laam in Nejd, he has claimed
kinship with Mohammed and they have been sitting together
affectionately all the morning, holding each an end of
Mohammed&rsquo;s rosary.&nbsp; We have cross-questioned him about
Nejd; but though he knows Ha&iuml;l and Kasim and other places,
he can give us little real <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>information.&nbsp; He seems to have
left it as a boy.&nbsp; We are cheered, however, by the little he
has had to tell us, as he seems to take it for granted that
everybody in Nejd will be delighted to see us, and he has given
us the name and address of his relations there.</p>
<p>Mohammed went last night to find out whether any of the Beni
Sokkhr Sheykhs were at the Suk, for it is to them that we have
letters from Mohammed Dukhi, and in the middle of the day
S&aacute;khn, a son of Fendi el-Faiz, the nominal head of the
tribe, was introduced.&nbsp; He was a not ill-looking youth, and
when we had shewn him our letter to his father informed us that
the Sheykh had just arrived, so we sent him to fetch him.&nbsp;
While Hanna was preparing coffee, the old man came to our
tent.&nbsp; In person he is very different from any of the
&Aacute;nazeh Sheykhs we have seen, reminding one rather of the
Jiburi, or other Euphrates Arabs.&nbsp; The Beni Sokkhr are in
fact of Shimali or Northern race, which is quite distinct from
the Nejdi, to which both &Aacute;nazeh and Shammar belong.&nbsp;
He is a fine picturesque old man, with rugged features and grey
beard and an immense nose, which put us in mind of the
conventional Arab types of Scripture picture books, and seemed to
correspond with a suggestion I have heard made, that the Beni
Sokkhr <a name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a> are really the Beni Issachar, a lost
tribe.</p>
<p>The Sheykh was very much &ldquo;en
c&eacute;r&eacute;monie,&rdquo; and we found it difficult to
carry on conversation with <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>him.&nbsp; Either he had not much to
say, or did not care to say it to us; and the talk went on
principally between his second son Tell&aacute;l, a Christian
merchant (here on business), and Mohammed.&nbsp; We did not,
ourselves, broach the subject of our journey; but after coffee
had been served, Mohammed had a private conversation with the
Sheykh, which resulted in an invitation from him to his tents,
which he described as being somewhere near Zerka on the Haj road,
from which he will send us on to Maan, and ultimately to
J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; This plan, however, does not at all suit
Wilfrid, who is determined on exploring the Wady Sirh&aacute;n,
which no European has ever done, and he insists that we must go
first to Ezrak.&nbsp; Fendi, it appears, cannot take us that way,
as he is on bad terms with the Kreysheh, a branch of his own
tribe who are on the road.&nbsp; Perhaps, too, he is afraid of
the Roala.&nbsp; It is very perplexing, as some sort of
introduction we must have at starting, and yet we cannot afford
to go out of our way or even wait here indefinitely till Fendi is
ready.&nbsp; The Jerdeh people are after all not expected for
another two days, and it may be a week before they go on.</p>
<p>Later in the day Sottan, Fendi&rsquo;s youngest son, came to
us and offered to accompany us himself to J&ocirc;f, but at a
price which was altogether beyond our ideas.&nbsp; He had
travelled once with some English people on the Syrian frontier,
and had got foolish notions about money.&nbsp; Five pounds was
the sum we had thought of giving; and he talked about a
hundred.&nbsp; <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>So we sent him away.&nbsp; Later still, came a Shammar
from the Jebel, who said he was willing to go for fifteen
mejidies, and a Kreysheh who made similar offers.&nbsp; We have
engaged them both, but neither could do more than show us the
road.&nbsp; They would be no introduction.&nbsp; The difficulty,
by all accounts, of going down the Wady Sirh&aacute;n, is from
the Sherar&aacute;t, who hang about it, and who having no regular
Sheykh, cannot easily be dealt with.&nbsp; They are afraid,
however, of the Beni Sokkhr Sheykhs, and of course of Mohammed
Dukhi and Ibn Shaalan; and if we could only get a proper
representative of one or other of these to go with us, all would
be right.&nbsp; But how to get such a one is the question.</p>
<p>It has been very hot and oppressive here to-day, and the
appearance of rain is gone.&nbsp; The thermometer about noon
stood at 86&deg;.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 17.&mdash;We have decided not to wait here any
longer, but to go off to-morrow in the direction of Ezrak,
trusting to find some one on the road.&nbsp; We shall have to
pass through Bozra, and may have better luck there.&nbsp; Our
Shammar seems to think it will be all right; but the Kreysheh
came back this morning with a demand for thirty pounds, instead
of the two pounds ten shillings, which he informed Mohammed,
Fendi had told him to ask.&nbsp; He seems to be with Fendi,
although his branch of the tribe are not on terms with their
principal chief.&nbsp; He still talks, however, of coming on the
original terms, but that will be without <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Fendi&rsquo;s
permission.&nbsp; It is quite necessary to be, or appear to be
stingy with these people, as throwing money away is considered by
them the act of a simpleton.</p>
<p>Mohammed has been sent to the Suk to make some last purchases,
and inquire about two more camels.&nbsp; Now that it is decided
we are to go by the Wady Sirh&aacute;n, we shall be obliged to
buy two extra camels to carry food for the rest.&nbsp; In
ordinary seasons this would not be necessary, but this year
everybody tells us we shall find no pasture.&nbsp; <i>Altek</i>,
which is the camel food used at Damascus, is made of a sort of
grain, like small misshapen peas or lentils, the husk green and
the seed red.&nbsp; It is mixed up into dough with wheaten flour
and water, and then kneaded into egg-shaped balls five inches
long.&nbsp; Six of these balls are a camel&rsquo;s daily ration,
which, if he can pick up any rubbish by the way, will be enough
to keep him fat.&nbsp; We are carrying barley for the mares.</p>
<p>Aamar and Selim, our Tafazz relations, have come to pay us
their promised visit, and will perhaps accompany us
to-morrow.&nbsp; They brought with them a measure of
<i>fer&iacute;keh</i>, wheat crushed very fine, a sort of
burghul, some bread, and a couple of fowls; also Mohammed&rsquo;s
sheepskin coat, which one of the women has been lining for him;
and lastly, the little greyhound we saw at their house, all as a
present, or very nearly so, after the fashion of the country.</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>Mohammed has come back with two camels for our approval,
one a very handsome animal, but rather long-legged, the other
short and broad-chested like a prize-fighter.&nbsp; We have paid
ten pounds and eleven pounds for them.&nbsp; Nothing is
absolutely settled about who is going and who is not going with
us.&nbsp; Nothing but this, that we leave Mez&aacute;rib
to-morrow.</p>
<p>As I write, an immense hubbub and a cry of thieves from the
Suk.&nbsp; They are ducking a man in the lake.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 18.&mdash;Our caravan has lost some of its
members.&nbsp; To begin with the two guides, the Kreysheh and the
Shammar have failed to make their appearance.&nbsp; Then Abd
er-Rahman, the little Agheyl, came with a petition to be allowed
to go home.&nbsp; He was too young, he said, for such a journey,
and afraid he might die on the road.&nbsp; He had brought a
cousin with him as a substitute, who would do much better than
himself, for the cousin was afraid of nothing.&nbsp; The
substitute was then introduced, a wild picturesque creature all
rags and elf locks and with eyes like jet, armed too with a
matchlock rather longer than himself, and evidently no
Agheyl.&nbsp; We have agreed, however, to take him and let the
other go.&nbsp; Unwilling hands are worse than useless on a
journey.&nbsp; Lastly, the slave Awwad has gone.&nbsp; Like most
negroes he had too good an opinion of himself, and insisted on
being treated as something more than a servant, and on having a
<a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>donkey to
ride.&nbsp; So we have packed him too off.&nbsp; He was very
angry when told to go, and broke a rebab we had given him to play
on, for he could both play and sing well.&nbsp; We are now
reduced to our two selves, Mohammed, Abdallah, Hanna, Ibrahim and
the substitute&mdash;seven persons in all, but the Tafazz people
are to go the first two days&rsquo; march with us and help drive
the camels.</p>
<p>We were glad to get clear of the dirt and noise of the Suk,
and leaving the Haj road, took a cross track to the south-east,
which is to lead us to Bozra.&nbsp; All day long we have been
passing through a well-inhabited country, with plenty of villages
and a rich red soil, already ploughed, every acre of it, and
waiting only for rain.&nbsp; The road was full of people
travelling on donkey-back and on foot to Mez&aacute;rib, singing
as they went along.&nbsp; In all the numerous villages we saw the
effects of the late murrain in the dead cattle strewed
about.&nbsp; I counted seventy carcasses in one small place, a
terrible loss for the poor villagers, as each working cow or
bullock was worth ten pounds.&nbsp; I asked what disease had
killed them, and was told it was &ldquo;min Allah&rdquo; (from
God).&nbsp; Mohammed, however, calls it <i>abu hadlan</i> (father
of leanness).</p>
<p>This district is said to be the best corn-growing country
anywhere, and looks like it, but unless rain falls soon, the year
must be barren.&nbsp; The villages depend almost entirely on rain
for their water supply.&nbsp; In each there is an old reservoir
hollowed <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>out of the rock.&nbsp; It is difficult to understand how
these tanks get filled, for they seem to have no drainage leading
to them, being on the contrary perched up generally on high
ground.&nbsp; They are now all dry, and the villagers have to
send many miles for their drinking water.&nbsp; All this country
belongs to the Hauran, and we are now in a Haurani village called
Gh&iacute;zeh.&nbsp; The people are evidently not pure Arabs, as
many of them have light eyes.</p>
<p>We are being hospitably entertained by the village Sheykh, who
is an old acquaintance of Mohammed&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s, and
insists on setting all he has got before us,&mdash;coffee, a
plate of rice, barley for the mares, and, what is more precious
just now, water for them as well as for ourselves.&nbsp; Hassan,
for such is his name, has a very pretty wife, who was among the
crowd which gathered round us on our arrival at the
village.&nbsp; She, like the women of all these villages, made no
pretence of shyness, and was running about unveiled as any
peasant girl might in Italy.&nbsp; She was evidently a spoilt
child, and required more than one command from Hassan before she
would go home.&nbsp; The Sheykh has been spending the evening
with us.&nbsp; He is in great distress about his village, which
is in the last straits for water.&nbsp; The cattle, as I have
said, have all died, and now even the beasts of burden which have
to go for the water are dying.&nbsp; The nearest spring is at
Bozra, twelve miles off; and if the donkeys break down the
village must die too of thirst.&nbsp; He <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>told us that
a Frank passed this way two years ago, and had told him that
there must be an ancient well somewhere among the ruins of which
the village is built, and he has been looking for it ever
since.&nbsp; He entreated us to tell him the most likely spot
either for finding the old well or digging a new one.&nbsp; We
are much distressed at not being engineers enough to do this for
him; and I can&rsquo;t help thinking how much a real reformer
(not a Midhat) might do in Turkey by attending to such crying
wants as these.&nbsp; Gh&iacute;zeh is within fifty miles from
Damascus as the crow flies, and there are scores of villages in
like condition throughout the Hauran, which a Syrian governor
might relieve at the cost of sending round an engineer.&nbsp; But
until tramways and railroads and new bazaars have been made, I
suppose there is little chance for mere wells under the present
regime.</p>
<p>Besides meat and drink, Hassan has given us useful
advice.&nbsp; He has reminded Mohammed of another old friend of
his father&rsquo;s, who he thinks might be of more service to us
than anybody else could be, and he advises us to go first to
him.&nbsp; This is Huseyn ibn Nejm el-Atrash, a powerful Druse
Sheykh, who lives somewhere beyond the Hauran mountains.&nbsp; He
must certainly have relations with some of the Bedouin tribes
beyond, for it appears he lives in a little town quite on the
extreme edge of the inhabited country towards the Wady
Sirh&aacute;n.&nbsp; We have always heard of this Druse country
as <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>unsafe,
but what country is not called unsafe outside the regular Turkish
authority?&nbsp; The Gh&iacute;zeh Sheykh&rsquo;s suggestion
seems worth following, and we shall make for the Druse town.</p>
<p>The little greyhound Shiekhah (so called from a plant of that
name) is very docile and well-behaved.&nbsp; She is a regular
desert dog, and likes dates better than anything else.&nbsp; I
have made her a coat to wear at night for she is chilly.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 19.&mdash;Hassan with true hospitality did not
leave his house this morning, but let us depart quietly.&nbsp;
His coming to wish us good-bye would have looked like asking for
a present, and he evidently did not wish for anything of the
sort.&nbsp; This is the first time we have received hospitality
absolutely gratis in a town, for even when staying with
Mohammed&rsquo;s father at Tudmur, the women of the family had
eagerly asked for money.&nbsp; In the desert, Hassan&rsquo;s
behaviour would not have needed remark.</p>
<p>Before leaving Gh&iacute;zeh we went to look at a house where
there is a mosaic floor of old Roman work, scrolls with orange
trees and pomegranates, vines with grapes on them, vases and
baskets, all coloured on a white ground.&nbsp; It speaks well for
the quality of the workmanship that it has so long stood the
weather and the wear, for it is out of doors, and forms the
pavement in the courtyard of a house.</p>
<p>Three and a half hours of steady marching brought us to Bozra,
where we now are.&nbsp; The entrance of <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>the town is
rather striking, as the old Roman road, which has run in a
straight line for miles, terminates in a gateway of the regular
classic style, beyond which lie a mass of ruins and pillars, and
to the right a fine old castle.&nbsp; A raven was sitting on the
gateway, and as we rode through solemnly said
&ldquo;caw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bozra is, I have no doubt, described by Mr. Murray, so I
won&rsquo;t waste my time in writing about the ruins, which
indeed we have not yet examined.&nbsp; They seem to be Roman, and
in tolerable preservation.&nbsp; The castle is more modern,
probably Saracenic, a huge pile built up out of older
fragments.&nbsp; It is occupied by a small garrison of Turkish
regulars, the last, I hope, we shall see for many a day, for
Bozra is the frontier town of the Hauran, and beyond it the
Sultan is not acknowledged.&nbsp; I believe that its occupation
is not of older date than fifteen to twenty years ago, the time
when Turkey made its last flicker as a progressing state, and
that before that time the people of Bozra paid tribute to Ibn
Shaalan, as they once had to the Wahhabis of Nejd.&nbsp; The
Roala still keep up some connection with the town, however, for a
shepherd we met at the springs just outside it assured us that
Ibn Shaalan had watered his camels at them not two months
ago.&nbsp; It was somewhere not far from Bozra that the forty
days battle between the Mesenneh and the Roala, described by
Fatalla, <a name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51"
class="citation">[51]</a> was fought.&nbsp; Though the <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>details are
no doubt exaggerated, Mohammed knows of the battle by
tradition.&nbsp; Wilfrid asked him particularly about it to-day,
and he fully confirms the account given by Fatalla of the
downfall of the Mesenneh.&nbsp; He has added too some interesting
details of their recent history.&nbsp; We are encamped outside
the town at the edge of a great square tank of ancient masonry,
now out of repair and dry.&nbsp; Here would be another excellent
occupation for Midhat and his Circassians.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 20.&mdash;We were disturbed all night by the
barking of dogs, and the strange echoes from the ruined places
round.&nbsp; I never heard anything so unearthly&mdash;a cold
night&mdash;and melancholy too, as nights are when the moon rises
late, and is then mixed up in a haggard light with the dawn.</p>
<p>The Tafazz relations are gone, very sorrowful to wish us
good-bye.&nbsp; Selim, the elder of the two, told me that he has
been thirty years now in the Hauran, and has no idea of going
back to Tudmur.&nbsp; The land at Tafazz is so good that it will
grow anything, while at Tudmur there are only the few gardens the
stream waters.&nbsp; He is a <i>fellah</i> and likes ploughing
and sowing better than camel driving.&nbsp; To Tafazz they are
gone, Selim on his chestnut mare, old, worn, and one-eyed, but
<i>asil</i>; Aamar on his bay Keh&icirc;leh from the Roala, also
old and very lame.&nbsp; They went with tears in their <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>eyes, wishing
us all possible blessings for the road.</p>
<p>The consequence is, we have to do more than our share of work,
and have had a hard day loading and reloading the camels, for we
were among the hills, and the roads were bad.&nbsp; The beasts
have not yet become accustomed to each other, and the old camel
we bought at Mez&aacute;rib shows every sign of wishing to return
there.&nbsp; He is an artful old wretch, and chose his moment for
wandering off whenever we were looking the other way, and
wherever a bit of uneven ground favoured his escape.&nbsp; Once
or twice he very nearly gave us the slip.&nbsp; He wants to get
back to his family, Abdallah says, for we bought him out of a
herd where he was lord and master, a sultan among camels.&nbsp;
Our road to-day has been very rough.&nbsp; We were told to make
our way to Salkhad, a point on the far horizon, just on the ridge
of the Hauran, and the only road there was the old Roman
one.&nbsp; This went in an absolutely straight line over hill and
dale, and as two out of every three of the stones paving it were
missing, and the rest turned upside down, it was a long stumble
from beginning to end.&nbsp; We had been warned to keep a good
look-out for robbers, so Wilfrid and I rode ahead, reconnoitering
every rock and heap.&nbsp; We passed one or two ruined villages,
but met nobody all day long, still following the pointed hill of
Salkhad, which, as we got nearer it, we could see was crowned by
a huge fortress.&nbsp; <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>The country had now become a mass of
boulders, which in places had been rolled into heaps, making
gigantic cairns, not recently, but perhaps in ancient days, when
there were giants in the land.&nbsp; The soil thus uncovered was
a rich red earth, and here and there it had been
cultivated.&nbsp; There was now a little pasture, for on the
hills rain had fallen, and once we saw some goats in the
distance.</p>
<p>As we approached Salkhad the road got so bad that Mohammed
made a vow of killing a sheep if ever we got safe to Huseyn
el-Atrash.&nbsp; We were amused at this and asked him what it
meant; and he told us the story of the prophet Ibrahim who made a
vow to kill his son, and who was prevented from doing so by the
prophet Musa, who appeared to him and stopped him, and showed him
two rams which he said would do instead.&nbsp; These vows the
Arabs make are very curious, and are certainly a relic of the
ancient sacrifices.&nbsp; Mohammed explained them to us.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Bedouins,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;always do this when
they are in difficulties,&rdquo; he could not say why, but it was
an old custom; and when they go back home they kill the sheep,
and eat it with their friends.&nbsp; He does not seem to consider
it a religious ceremony, only a custom, but it is very
singular.</p>
<p>Nine and a half hours&rsquo; march from seven o&rsquo;clock
brought us to the foot of the conical hill, on which the fortress
of Salkhad stands.&nbsp; This is a very ancient building,
resembling not a little the fortress of Aleppo, a cone partly
artificial and surrounded by a <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>moat, cased with smooth stone and
surmounted by walls still nearly perfect.&nbsp; We remarked on
some of them the same device as at Aleppo, a rampant lion, the
emblem of the Persian Monarchy.&nbsp; The fortress itself,
however, is probably of much older date, and may have existed at
the time the children of Israel conquered the country.&nbsp;
Wilfrid and I, who had gone on in front, agreed to separate here,
and ride round the citadel, he to the right, and I to the left,
and I was to wait on the top of the ridge till he gave me some
signal.&nbsp; This I did and waited so long, that at last the
camels came up.&nbsp; He in the meantime had found a little town
just under the fortress on the other side and had ridden down
into it.&nbsp; At first he saw nobody, and thought the place
deserted, but presently people in white turbans began to appear
on the house-tops, very much astonished to see this horseman come
riding down upon them, for the road was like a stair.&nbsp; He
saluted them, and they saluted politely in return, and answered
his inquiry for Huseyn el-Atrash, by pointing out a path which
led down across the hills to a town called Melakh, where they
said Huseyn lived.&nbsp; They asked where he was going, and he
said Bussora, Bussora of Bagdad, at which they laughed, and
showing him the Roman road, which from Salkhad still goes on in a
straight line about south-east, said that that would take him to
it.&nbsp; This is curious, for it certainly is exactly the
direction, and yet it is impossible there can ever have really
been a road there.&nbsp; It probably goes to Ezrak <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>but we hope
to find out all about this in a day or two.&nbsp; At the bottom
of the hill Wilfrid beckoned to me, and I found him at a large
artificial pool or reservoir, still containing a fair supply of
water, and there, when the rest had joined us, we watered the
camels and horses.&nbsp; Mohammed in the meanwhile had been also
on a voyage of discovery, and came back with the news that Huseyn
el-Atrash was really at Melakh, and Melakh was only two hours and
a half further on.</p>
<p>Salkhad is a very picturesque town.&nbsp; It hangs something
like a honeycomb under the old fortress on an extremely steep
slope, the houses looking black from the colour of the volcanic
stone of which they are built.&nbsp; Many of them are very
ancient, and the rest are built up of ancient materials, and
there is a square tower like the belfry of a church. <a
name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56"
class="citation">[56]</a>&nbsp; The tanks below are at least
equally old with the town, having a casing of hewn stone, now
much dilapidated, and large stone troughs for watering
cattle.&nbsp; Its inhabitants, the people in the white turbans,
are Druses, a colony sent I believe from the Lebanon after the
disturbances in 1860.</p>
<p>From Salkhad our road lay principally down hill, for we had
now crossed the watershed of the Jebel <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Hauran, and became somewhat
intricate, winding about among small fields.&nbsp; The country on
this side the hills is divided into walled enclosures, formed by
the rolling away of boulders, which give it a more European look
than anything we have seen of late.&nbsp; These date I should
think from very early times, for the stones have had time to get
covered with a grey lichen, so as to resemble natural rather than
artificial heaps, and in these dry climates lichen forms
slowly.&nbsp; In some of the enclosures we found cultivation, and
even vines and fig-trees.&nbsp; It is remarkable how much more
prosperous the land looks as soon as one gets away from Turkish
administration.&nbsp; The sun was setting as we first caught
sight of Melakh, another strange old medi&aelig;val town of black
stone, with walls and towers much out of the perpendicular; so
leaving the camels to come on under Abdallah&rsquo;s charge and
that of a man who had volunteered to guide us, we cantered on
with Mohammed, and in the twilight arrived at the house of Huseyn
el-Atrash.</p>
<p>Huseyn is a fine specimen of a Druse sheykh, a man of about
forty, extremely dark and extremely handsome, his eyes made
darker and more brilliant by being painted with kohl.&nbsp; This
seems to be a general fashion here.&nbsp; He was very clean and
well dressed in j&iacute;bbeh and abba; and, unlike most of the
Druses, he wore a kefiyeh of purple and gold, though with the
white turban over it in place of the aghal.&nbsp; He was sitting
with his friends and <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>neighbours on a little terrace in
front of his house, enjoying the coolness of the evening, while
we could see that a fire had been lit indoors.&nbsp; He rose and
came to meet us as we dismounted, and begged us to come in, and
then the coffee pots and mortar were set at work and a dinner was
ordered.&nbsp; The Sheykh&rsquo;s manners were excellent, very
ceremonious but not cold, and though we conversed for an hour
about &ldquo;the weather and the crops,&rdquo; he carefully
avoided asking questions as to who we were and what we
wanted.&nbsp; Neither did we say anything, as we knew that the
proper moment had not come.&nbsp; At last our camels arrived, and
dinner was served, a most excellent one, chicken and burghul,
horse-radishes in vinegar and water, several sweet dishes, one a
puree of rice, spiced tea, cream cheese, and the best water-melon
ever tasted.&nbsp; The cookery and the people remind us of the
frontier towns of the Sahara, everything good of its kind, good
food, good manners, and good welcome.&nbsp; Then, when we had all
eaten heartily down to the last servant, he asked us who we
were.&nbsp; Mohammed&rsquo;s answer that we were English persons
of distinction, on our way to J&ocirc;f, and that he was
Mohammed, the son of Abdallah of Tudmur, made quite a <i>coup de
th&eacute;&acirc;tre</i>, and it is easy to see that we have at
last come to the right place.&nbsp; We have been, however, glad
to retire early, for we have had a hard day&rsquo;s march, nearly
twelve hours, and over exceedingly bad ground.</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span><i>December</i> 21.&mdash;The shortest day of the year,
but still hot, though the night was cold.</p>
<p>We spent the morning with Huseyn.&nbsp; His house has not long
been built, but it looks old because it is built of old
stones.&nbsp; Its construction is simple but good, the main room
being divided into sections with arches so as to suit the stone
rafters with which it is roofed.&nbsp; In front there is a
pleasant terrace overlooking an agreeable prospect of broken
ground, with glimpses of the desert beyond.&nbsp; While Wilfrid
was talking to Huseyn I went to see the ladies of the
establishment.&nbsp; Huseyn has only one wife; her name is Wardi
(a rose).&nbsp; She is the mother of a nice little boy, Mohammed,
about six years old and very well behaved, whom we had seen with
the Sheykh; and of a pretty little girl of two, named
Amina.&nbsp; There are, besides, some older children by a former
husband.&nbsp; Wardi is rather fat, with a brilliant complexion
and well-kohled eyes and eyebrows; she has good manners, and
received me very cordially in a room opening on to a terrace,
with a beautiful view eastward of some tells at the edge of the
Hamad.&nbsp; She sat surrounded by dependants and relations,
among whom were Huseyn&rsquo;s mother and her own.&nbsp; The
former was suffering from cough and loss of voice, and another
member of the family complained of a rheumatic arm; both wanted
me to advise them as to treatment.&nbsp; The ladies would not
uncover their faces until Assad, the Sheykh&rsquo;s secretary,
who accompanied <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>me, had retired.&nbsp; Wardi&rsquo;s concealment of her
features was, however, a mere make-believe, only a corner of her
head veil pulled half across her face.&nbsp; She talked a great
deal about her children of the former marriage, Mustafa a son of
eighteen, who is chief of a neighbouring village, and a daughter
of perhaps twelve who was present.&nbsp; This young girl seemed
particularly intelligent and had received some education; enough
to read out a phrase from my Arabic exercise book, and to repeat
the first chapter of the Koran.&nbsp; The pleasure of my visit
was somewhat marred by the quantity of sweetmeats and tea and
coffee served; with the tea and coffee I got on very well, as the
cups were of the usual small size, but the sugar-plums were of so
massive a kind that it was impossible to swallow them.&nbsp; The
two small children fortunately came to my rescue; and by their
zeal in devouring everything I handed to them, took off their
mother&rsquo;s attention from my shortcomings.&nbsp; At parting
Wardi gave me a bunch of feathers pulled then and there out of an
ostrich skin hanging up against the wall; the skin, she said, had
been brought to her some months before, from somewhere in the
south.</p>
<p>The Druses of the Hauran say that they are Arabs who came here
with the immediate successors of the prophet from the south; that
the Jebel was at that time inhabited by R&ucirc;mi (Greeks),
whose descendants still live here and are Christians.&nbsp; We
saw one of them in Huseyn&rsquo;s house to-day, <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>apparently on
excellent terms with the other visitors.&nbsp; He was dressed
like an Arab, and was undistinguishable from the ordinary
fell&aacute;h&iacute;n Arabs one sees in the desert towns.&nbsp;
The Druse women, except those of Huseyn&rsquo;s family, go about
unveiled.&nbsp; They are particularly well-mannered and civil,
with clean fresh complexions and bright coloured cheeks, and
always say &ldquo;Salam aleykum&rdquo; to travellers.&nbsp; They
all kohl their eyes carefully and broadly.</p>
<p>There has of course been much discussion about our further
journey.&nbsp; It is rather aggravating to think that a whole
week has passed since we left Damascus, and yet we are not, as
the crow flies, more than eighty miles on our way.&nbsp; Still
there seems a chance now of our really getting forward, for
Huseyn promises to send some men with us to K&acirc;f, an oasis
in the Wady Sirh&aacute;n, with which there is occasional
communication on this side of the Hauran, as there are salt beds
to which the villagers send camels to fetch salt.&nbsp; They say
it is about five days&rsquo; journey from here.&nbsp; The
principal difficulty is that there are several Bedouin tribes on
the road, and nobody knows which.&nbsp; The Sird&iacute;eh are
friends of Huseyn&rsquo;s, and so are the Kreysheh, but there are
others whom he does not know, Sherar&acirc;t Sirh&aacute;n and
Howeysin, the last mere thieves &ldquo;worse than the
Sleb.&rdquo;&nbsp; Any or all of these may be met with, though it
is very possible we may meet nobody.&nbsp; Huseyn has sent a man
on horseback to Ezrak, the first stage on our way, where there
are <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>wells
and an old castle, to find out who is there.&nbsp; The Kreysheh
we have letters to, from Mohammed Dukhi, and if we can find them
there will be no more difficulty, as they are strong enough to
give us protection from the rest.&nbsp; At any rate we go on
to-morrow.&nbsp; We are anxious to get away to the desert, for
life is very fatiguing in these towns; there are so many people
to be civil to, and the children make such a noise.&nbsp; They
have been playing hockey all day long just outside our tent,
tiresome little wretches.&nbsp; Wilfrid went out for an hour this
afternoon, and got some grouse, of which there are immense flocks
all about the fields, while I made a picture of the town from
behind a wall.</p>
<p>We have at last got a man to go with us as servant, who looks
promising.&nbsp; He is a Shammari from Jebel Shammar who, for
some reason or other, has left his own tribe (probably for some
crime against Bedouin law), and has been settled for the last few
years at Salkhad, where he has married a Druse woman.&nbsp; There
is some mystery about his profession and way of life, but he has
an attractive face, and in spite of very poor clothes a certain
air of distinction.&nbsp; We both like him, and Huseyn seems to
know something about him.&nbsp; Besides, he has made the whole
journey from Nejd already, and has been backwards and forwards
between Salkhad and J&ocirc;f more than once.&nbsp; He wants now,
he says, to go back to his own country.&nbsp; Mohammed has also
discovered a <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>red-headed man, a native of Sokhne and as such almost a
fellow countryman, who will come as camel driver under Abdallah;
so that our complement of hands is made up to its original
number, eight.</p>
<p>To-morrow we may hope to sleep in the desert.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Note</i>.&nbsp; Alas, since this was written, our friends
at Melakh have experienced sad reverses.&nbsp; In September,
1879, Midhat Pasha, to signalize his assumption of office at
Damascus, and support that reputation of energy which Europe has
given him, sent an armed force to coerce the independent
Druses.&nbsp; At first these, fighting for their liberty, were
successful.&nbsp; They met and defeated the Turkish troops
advancing through the Leja, and the expedition returned with a
loss of 400 men.&nbsp; A month later, however, Midhat retrieved
his fortunes.&nbsp; He bribed or persuaded Mohammed Dukhi to
overrun the Eastern Hauran with his Bedouins, and while these
were blockading the towns, marched a second column of regular
troops through the mountains, and so gained possession of
Salkhad, Melakh, and the rest, reducing all to submission.&nbsp;
An Ottoman Governor now replaces the native Sheykhs, and the
blessings of the Sultan&rsquo;s rule have been extended to every
village of the Hauran.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 22.&mdash;A white frost, and off at half-past
seven.&nbsp; Huseyn has sent two men with us, Assad, his head
man, and another.&nbsp; We have also letters from him for Ali
el-Kreysheh, and the Sheykh of K&acirc;f.</p>
<p>Mohammed as we rode away was much elated at the success of
this visit, and related to me the pretty things Huseyn had said
about us.&nbsp; Huseyn had seen other franjis but none who
understood the <i>shoghl Arab</i>, Arab ways, as we did.&nbsp;
They had come with an escort to see the ruins, but we had come to
see him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mohammed, &ldquo;now they
are sitting drinking coffee and talking about us.&nbsp; They are
saying to each other that the Beg and I are brothers, and we are
travelling together, as is right, in search of relations, and to
make friends all over the world.&nbsp; There is nothing so
<i>asil</i> (noble) as to travel and make friends.&nbsp; Once
upon a time <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>there was an old man who had a son, but very little
other property, and when he came to die he called his son and
said to him, &ldquo;O my son, I am about to die, and I have
nothing to leave behind me for your good but advice, and my
advice is this: &lsquo;Build to yourself houses in every part of
the world.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; And the son, who was a child
without understanding, wondered how he was to do this, seeing he
had no money to build houses with, and so set out on a journey in
search of a wise man who could explain to him his father&rsquo;s
last words.&nbsp; And he travelled for many years and visited
every part of the world, and made friends in each town, and at
last he found the wise man who told him that he had already done
as his father had bidden him, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;you have friends everywhere, and is not your
friend&rsquo;s house your own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We too were in high spirits, as everything now seemed to be
going right.&nbsp; Our course lay nearly south on the road to
Ezrak, and we passed several ruined villages and some cultivated
land.&nbsp; Every now and then we put up immense packs of
sand-grouse, which were busy feeding on the seeds of the
<i>zueyti</i>, a kind of thistle which grows abundantly on the
fallows.&nbsp; Wilfrid got eight of them at a shot, and at one of
the villages we bought ten partridges of a man who had been out
with a matchlock, so that we are well supplied with meat for a
couple of days.&nbsp; Assad has got a very handsome greyhound <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>with him, of
the long-haired breed, which has a wonderful nose for game.&nbsp;
His master declares he <i>sees</i> the birds, for the Arabs do
not seem to understand the theory of scent.</p>
<p>After two hours&rsquo; fair travelling, we stopped at a
village called Met&eacute;m, where Assad had friends, and where
we were obliged to go through the ceremony of drinking coffee,
losing much time thereby.&nbsp; Then a new discussion arose as to
our road, somebody having just come in from Ezrak, who announced
that the Sirh&aacute;n were camped there, and the Sirh&aacute;n
we knew were friendly with Huseyn el-Atrash.&nbsp; Assad, and
Salman his companion, refused in consequence to go that way, and
were for stopping the night at Met&eacute;m to think over it; but
this we would not listen to.&nbsp; We were determined to go
somewhere, and if not to Ezrak then by some other route to
K&acirc;f.&nbsp; Somebody suggested El Kreysheh, who was said to
be in the Wady er-Rajel, and others the Sird&iacute;eh, who were
camped a day&rsquo;s journey towards the east.&nbsp; It was
difficult to decide; but at the well of the village while we were
watering our animals, we met a man and his wife, who told us they
knew where to find the Sird&iacute;eh, and were themselves on
their way to join them.&nbsp; So this decided us, and we
determined on the Sird&iacute;eh.&nbsp; The Sird&iacute;eh are
friends of Huseyn&rsquo;s, and our Druse guides made no objection
to going that way; Awwad the Shammari declared also that it was
all right.&nbsp; Accordingly we left the Ezrak road, <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>and striking
off to the east, soon found ourselves out of the range of
cultivation.&nbsp; Met&eacute;m is to be the last village we
shall see, and the desert is now before us all the way to
Nejd.</p>
<p>We are encamped at the edge of a plateau, from which there is
an immense prospect of hill and plain, and Wilfrid has been very
busy making out a rough chart of the different landmarks, as they
may be useful to-morrow if we should happen to miss our
way.&nbsp; The man and woman we met at the well are with us, and
know the different points by name.&nbsp; Awwad too, declares he
knows every part of the desert between this and K&acirc;f and he
has pointed out a tell, south-east by south, beyond which it
lies.&nbsp; The Druses, like townsmen, are already nervous at the
sight of the desert, and angry with us for camping away from
villages and tents.&nbsp; Our camp is well concealed in an old
volcanic crater, where also we are sheltered from the wind, which
is very cold.&nbsp; There is a spring just below called Ain
el-Ghiaour (the infidel&rsquo;s spring); according to the Druses,
the scene of a great battle fought by the Arabs of the first
invasion, in which they routed the Christians.&nbsp; At that time
all the country we have been passing through, and perhaps the
broken ground in front of us, was well inhabited; and there is a
tell with a ruined convent on it not far off to the north-west,
still known as Ed Deyr.&nbsp; There is capital pasture here,
<i>rotha</i>, which the camels have been making the most
of.&nbsp; We too <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>have dined, and now all is quiet, and the sky is full of
stars.&nbsp; We have been sitting on the edge of the crater
talking over plans for to-morrow.&nbsp; The Sird&iacute;eh, it
now appears, are at a <i>khabra</i> or pool, called Shubboitia,
which we could see before the sun set like a yellow line far away
to the northeast, too far out of our road for us to go
there.&nbsp; Awwad is in favour of going straight to K&acirc;f
and taking our chance of what Arabs we may meet.&nbsp; El
Kreysheh is somewhere in front of us, and so they say is Ibn
Majil, the Akid of the Roala, whom we met last year.&nbsp; At any
rate, we must take a good supply of water with us, and go forward
at the first streak of dawn.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 23.&mdash;As soon as it was light we climbed
up to the top of the crater and looked over the plain.&nbsp; It
was a wonderful sight with its broken tells and strange chaotic
wadys, all black with volcanic boulders, looking blacker still
against the yellow morning sky.&nbsp; There is always something
mysterious about a great plain, and especially such a plain as
this, where Europeans, one may say, have never been, and which
even the people of the Hauran know little of.&nbsp; Besides, it
seems to have had a history if only in the days of Og, king of
Basan.&nbsp; But it was not to look at the view or for any
romantic reason that we had come there; only to examine the
country before us and see if we could discover traces of Arab
encampments.&nbsp; After looking carefully all round we at <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>last made out
a thin column of smoke to the northeast, ten or twelve miles
away, and another nearly due east.&nbsp; The first must be the
Sird&iacute;eh, the second perhaps the Kreysheh.&nbsp; Satisfied
with this we returned to our party, who were just setting the
camels in motion, and as the sun rose we began our march.</p>
<p>We have been stumbling about all day among the boulders of the
Harra, following little tracks just wide enough for the camels to
get along, and making a great circuit in order to find ourselves
at last barely twelve miles from where we began.&nbsp; At first
we kept company with our new acquaintances, the people going to
the Sird&iacute;eh, but when we had arrived at the foot of the
hills we found them turning away to the north, and so wished them
good-bye, much to the Druses&rsquo; disgust, who did not at all
relish our wild-goose chase of the Kreysheh, and still less the
idea of going straight to K&acirc;f.&nbsp; They followed,
however, when they found that we would listen to no reason, and I
must say good-humouredly.&nbsp; One great charm of the Arab
character is that it bears no malice, even about trifles.&nbsp;
Sulkiness is very rare with them.&nbsp; They did not pretend to
know much of the country, so we made Awwad lead the way.&nbsp;
Going straight was out of the question, for the Harra is an
impracticable country, not only for camels but for horses, on
account of the boulders, except just where the paths lead.&nbsp;
We had a bleak desolate ride, for a cold wind had sprung up in
our faces with a decided <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>touch of winter.&nbsp; This country
must be a furnace, however, in summer with its polished black
stones.&nbsp; I noticed that these were very regularly weathered;
one side, that towards the north, being grey with a sort of
lichen, so that as we rode past they seemed to change colour
continually.&nbsp; There was very little sign of life in this
region, only a few small birds, and no trace of inhabitants or of
any recent passers by.&nbsp; The tracks followed generally the
beds of wadys, and wandered on without any particular aim or
direction.&nbsp; They looked like the paths made by sheep or
camels, only that the stones were so big it seemed impossible
that the mere passage of animals could have ever made them.&nbsp;
On the whole I think they must be artificial, made by shepherds
in very ancient times for their flocks.&nbsp; In the spring, we
are told, the whole of this Harra is excellent grazing
ground.&nbsp; It is a curious thing that every here and there in
the hollows there is a space free from stones where water lies
after rain, forming a pool.&nbsp; Why are there no stones
there?&nbsp; The soil is a dry clay with a highly glazed surface
cracked into very regular squares, so glazed indeed that even
close by it has the appearance of water, reflecting the light of
the sky.&nbsp; This, no doubt, is the way some of the curious
mirage effects are produced in the desert, for it is to be
noticed that the most perfect delusions are found just in places
where one would naturally expect to find water&mdash;that is,
where water has been.</p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>At
half-past twelve, we came suddenly on a level bit of open ground,
which we took at first for one of these khabras, but found it to
be part of a long wady running north and south, with a very
distinct watercourse in the middle, with tamarisk bushes, and
patches of fresh grass, showing that water had run down it not
long ago.&nbsp; Both Awwad and the Druses recognised this as the
Wady-er-Rajel, where the Kreysheh were reported to be encamped,
and the only question was, whether to turn up or down it.&nbsp;
While we were debating, however, a flock of sheep was sighted,
and presently a boy, who told us he was a Sird&iacute;eh, but
that the Kreysheh were only a couple of hours further down the
valley.&nbsp; This just suited, as it was exactly in the right
direction for us, and we are now at Ali el-Kreysheh&rsquo;s camp,
and being hospitably entertained by a young relation in the
Sheykh&rsquo;s absence.&nbsp; Ali is away at Mez&aacute;rib with
fifty horsemen, to escort the Jerdeh on their way to Maan.</p>
<p>We have had some singing to-night, and playing of the
rebab.&nbsp; Among the songs I was pleased to recognise an old
Shammar ballad about Abdul Kerim and the man who had no mare.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 24.&mdash;The Kreysheh, at whose camp we now
are, belong to the Beni Sokkhr, a large, but not very warlike
tribe, which occupies the whole of the district from the pilgrim
road eastwards to the extreme edge of the Harra, throughout a
wilderness of stones.&nbsp; To this they are said to owe <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>their name of
Beni Sokkhr, children of the rocks; and they assure us that they
have lived in the Harra &ldquo;from all time.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
do not come from Nejd, they say, like the &Aacute;nazeh, but are
Shimali or Northern Arabs.&nbsp; We were told the names of ten
divisions into which the Beni Sokkhr have ramified, each owning a
separate Sheykh, though nominally subject to Fendi el-Faiz, or
rather his son S&oacute;ttan, for Fendi is old and has given up
practical authority.&nbsp; These divisions are probably nothing
more than groups of the tribe, as their names are those of their
Sheykhs, the principal being S&oacute;ttan, and next to him El
Kreysheh, and next again Ed Dreybi ibn Zebbed.&nbsp; The Kreysheh
have camels as well as sheep, and seem pretty well off; but they
have no great number of mares, and those not of the best
type.&nbsp; They keep hawks and greyhounds.</p>
<p>They have given us news of the Roala.&nbsp; Ibn Majil, whom we
met last year at Sotamm Ibn Shaalan&rsquo;s, and who took our
side in the negotiations for peace with the Sebaa, has now
separated from Sotamm, and is somewhere down by J&ocirc;f, so
perhaps we may meet him; while Sotamm has just marched north
again to attack the Welled Ali.&nbsp; The Kreysheh are friends
with Ibn Majil, but at war with Sotamm, another curious instance
of the inconsistencies of Bedouin politics.&nbsp; These are,
indeed, as changing as the clouds in the sky, and transform
themselves so rapidly, that in Desert history, if it were
written, <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>ten years would comprise as much incident as a century
in Europe.</p>
<p>While negotiations were going on about arrangements for our
further progress, I went to call on Ali el-Kreysheh&rsquo;s
wives.&nbsp; There are two of them, Hazna and Fassal; but I only
saw the latter, who had the women&rsquo;s tent to herself with
her attendants and three children, two little boys and a girl,
remarkably dirty, and (what is rare among Bedouins) suffering
from sore eyes.&nbsp; Fassal was plain and uninteresting but
sensible, and I daresay has the advantage over Hazna, who, poor
thing, is childless.&nbsp; She told me she was from a section of
the tribe further north, and took an interest in Damascus, asking
about the new Valy as well as about Mohammed ibn Smeyr, who is
the great name in these parts.&nbsp; She seemed much pleased with
the box of sugar-plums I gave her, and when I went away followed
me as far as the end of the tent ropes invoking blessings on my
head.</p>
<p>I found our own tents down and everything ready for a start;
for an arrangement had been come to with the young man
representing our host, that we were to have a <i>zellem</i>
(person) to go with us as far as K&acirc;f for the sum of ten
mejidies (forty shillings).&nbsp; Assad and Salman were just
saying good-bye, for they had to go back to Melakh.&nbsp; They
were made very happy with a Turkish pound apiece, and Assad has
left us his greyhound, the black and <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>tan dog, who whined piteously when
his master went away.&nbsp; I like the dog for this.</p>
<p>As we left the Kreysheh camp a bitter wind sprang up from the
west-south-west, and continued all day long, chilling us, in
spite of all the furs and cloaks we could put on, to the
bone.&nbsp; Our course lay nearly across it
south-south-east.&nbsp; We are out of the hills now in a nearly
level plain still covered with the black stones.&nbsp; The only
variety during the day was when we came to a large khabra
(Khabra-el-Gurrthi), a dreary flat of dried up clay and sand
which we took two hours to cross, though we went at the
camels&rsquo; best pace.&nbsp; The wind drove great clouds of
sand across it, making it one of the dreariest places I ever
saw.&nbsp; We were all too cold for much talking, and sat huddled
up on our del&uacute;ls with our backs to the wind, and our heads
wrapped up in our cloaks.&nbsp; We met no one all day long,
except one string of a dozen camels driven by two very
wild-looking Arabs who told us they were Sheshar&acirc;t, and
nothing living except a hare which got up among the stones, and
which the dogs coursed for some hundreds of yards, over ground
which would have broken every bone of an English greyhound,
apparently without hurting themselves.&nbsp; About two
o&rsquo;clock we came, to our great delight, upon the Wady
er-Rajel again, an angle of whose course we had been cutting
off.&nbsp; Here we found beautiful soft ground and grass and
pools of water, for this wady had running water in it last month,
<a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>and is not
quite drunk up yet.&nbsp; The pasture was too good to be passed,
so here we remain for the night.&nbsp; Just as we were unloading,
a little troop of gazelles looked over the edge of the wady,
perhaps come for water, and Mohammed set off in pursuit with a
Winchester rifle.&nbsp; We heard him fire all the twelve shots
one after the other, but he came back empty-handed.&nbsp; Our
tent is set under the lee of a rough wall of loose stones, such
as are set up by the shepherds as a shelter for their
flocks.&nbsp; The wind still blows tempestuously, and it is cold
as a Christmas Eve need be.&nbsp; But Hanna has made us a capital
curry, which with soup and burghul and a plum-pudding from a tin,
makes not a bad dinner, while Abdallah has distinguished himself
baking bread, and Awwad roasting coffee.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, <i>December</i> 25.&mdash;Christmas
Day.&nbsp; We are out of the Harra at last, and on open
ground.&nbsp; That black wilderness had become like a nightmare
with its horrible boulders and little tortuous paths, which
prevented the camels from doing more than about two miles an
hour.&nbsp; Now we are able to push on at three, or three and a
quarter.</p>
<p>After floundering down the wady for half an hour, we came to
some splendid pools in a narrow cleft of rock, where we stopped
to take in water.&nbsp; We have been very fortunate in such a
season as this to find the Wady er-Rajel full.&nbsp; The rain
which filled it must have been some isolated waterspout on the
eastern slope of Jebel Hauran, for not <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>a drop fell anywhere else; and there
is no autumn grass except just along its edge.&nbsp; It is
rapidly drying, or rather being drunk up, and the little
vegetation is very closely eaten down.&nbsp; In the smaller pools
there is a very distinct flavour of sheep and camels in the
water; but at the pools we came to this morning it is still
pure.&nbsp; The Kreysheh have been all up this valley, eating and
drinking their way, and leaving not a blade they could help
behind them, and we have come upon numerous tracks of their
cattle.&nbsp; Every here and there we have passed the traces of
their camps, stones set in line on three sides of a square; one
we saw had been only just deserted, and we put up a number of
vultures and ravens from the fresh carcase of a camel lying by
it.&nbsp; There crossed it also the footprint of a horse, which
brought on the usual talk of ghaz&uacute;s and marauders, in
which our people delight.&nbsp; They, however, have settled it
among them to their satisfaction, that such accidents as meeting
robbers or people of a hostile tribe are &ldquo;min Allah&rdquo;
(from God), to be classed with the rain and fine weather, and
sickness and good health, all which things the Bedouins consider
fortuitous.</p>
<p>Having filled our goat skins, we left the Wady er-Rajel for
good, and are to come across no more water now till we get to
K&acirc;f.&nbsp; The valley takes a turn here to the west before
it reaches the Wady Sirh&aacute;n, and would therefore be out of
our road.&nbsp; We have been crossing some rolling downs covered
<a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>with light
flinty gravel, a delightful change from the Harra, and have had a
gallop or two after the gazelles, which now and then came in
sight.&nbsp; We thought too of our Christmas dinner, and how glad
we should be to get some addition to the rice, which was all we
had; but neither greyhounds nor mares were in good enough
condition to run down their quarry.&nbsp; Once we made a rather
successful stalk, and a charge in among a small herd, but the
dogs could not get hold of anything, and, though several shots
were fired, nothing came to bag.&nbsp; Then we had a long gallop
after Sayad, the black and tan greyhound, who went on after the
gazelles for a good two miles, so that we were afraid of losing
him; and then another long gallop to get back to our
camels.&nbsp; This time, we had been three quarters of an hour
away from them, and we found our people all much alarmed,
Abdallah rather angry at our going so far, for Mohammed was with
us.&nbsp; He was perfectly in the right, and we were to blame,
for we are on a serious journey not a sporting tour; and to say
nothing of danger from enemies, there is always a certain risk of
missing one another in a country like this where camels leave no
track behind them.&nbsp; A turn to right or left out of the
direct line and a fold in the ground, and they are lost.&nbsp; So
we apologised, and promised to do so again no more.&nbsp; We
were, however, in a most unexpected manner provided with dinner;
for while we were still talking, behold a grazing camel <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>all alone on
the plain, not a mile away; when with a general shout of &ldquo;a
prize,&rdquo; the whole party on horseback and on foot rushed in
pursuit.&nbsp; We were naturally the first up, and drove the
animal at a canter to the others.&nbsp; The camel was a young one
of last spring, in good condition, and at the sight tears rushed
into Hanna&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;tears of hunger, not of pity.&nbsp;
I am afraid indeed that none of the party had much thought of
pity, and the scene caused me mixed feelings of compassion for
the poor victim, and disgust at ourselves who were waiting to
prey upon it.&nbsp; No question was raised as to ownership;
camels found astray in desert places were by acclamation declared
the property of the first comer.&nbsp; We were in fact a
ghaz&uacute;, and this was our lawful prize.&nbsp; So the poor
little camel was driven on before us.</p>
<p>Dinner is thus secured, and I must see what else can be
arranged in honour of the occasion.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 26.&mdash;Mohammed, Abdallah, Awwad, the two
Ibrahims and Hanna, all of them, spent the evening in feasting
and ate up the whole of the camel except the short ribs, which
were set before us, and the shoulders which were kept for
to-day.&nbsp; They divided among them the labour of killing,
skinning and quartering, and cooking it, for all were equally
ready to lend a hand to the work.&nbsp; People talk sometimes of
camel meat, as if it were something not only unpalatable, but
offensive.&nbsp; But it is in reality very good; when young it
resembles mutton, even when old it is only tough, and never <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>has any
unpleasant taste as far as my experience goes; indeed if served
up without the bones it could hardly be distinguished from
mutton.</p>
<p>The servants having thus feasted were all soon sound asleep,
and even when suddenly, between two and three in the morning, the
wind rose with a deafening noise, they did not wake, not till
their tent blew down upon them as ours did upon us.&nbsp; We were
awake and might have kept our tent standing had we not been too
lazy to get up and drive in the pegs.&nbsp; It was too late when
the tent had fallen on us to do anything but lie as well as we
could beneath the ruins and wait for daylight.&nbsp; Fortunately
the main pegs had not drawn, and the sand, for this hurricane was
a sand storm, soon covered over the edges of the fallen tent, and
no further damage was done.&nbsp; In the morning, the servants
proposed staying where we were; but we would not hear of this, as
we had water for only two days, and it would have been folly to
dawdle, so after rubbing the sand out of or rather into our eyes,
we set to work packing and loading.&nbsp; The wind continued
violent and bitterly cold, and carried a great deal of sand with
it.&nbsp; It came from the west-south-west.&nbsp; We had camped
under shelter at a small tell close to the Tell Guteyfi, which
proved to be the same as one pointed out to us by Awwad from Ain
el-Giaour, and once beyond it, we found ourselves on a perfectly
open bit of plain, exposed to the full fury of the gale, now more
violent than <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>ever.&nbsp; Sand storms are evidently common here, for
the Tell Guteyfi, which is of black volcanic boulders like the
Harra, is half smothered in sand.&nbsp; We saw it looming near us
in the thick air, and soon after were almost hidden from each
other in the increasing darkness.&nbsp; The sun shone feebly at
intervals through the driving sand, but it was all we could do to
keep the caravan together, and not lose sight of each
other.&nbsp; At one moment we had all to stop and turn tail to
the wind, covering our eyes and heads with our cloaks, waiting
till the burst was over.&nbsp; Nothing could have faced it.&nbsp;
Still we were far from having any idea of danger, for there
really is none in these storms, and had plenty of time to notice
how very picturesque the situation was, the camels driven along
at speed, all huddled together for protection, with their long
necks stretched out, and heads low, tags and ropes flying, and
the men&rsquo;s cloaks streaming in the wind, all seen through
the yellow haze of sand which made them look as though walking in
the air.&nbsp; The beasts looked gigantic yet helpless, like
antediluvian creatures overwhelmed in a flood.&nbsp; Still, as I
said, there was no danger, for the wind was steady in its
direction, and our course was directly across it&mdash;that we
knew&mdash;and by patiently struggling on, we managed to get over
a deal of ground.&nbsp; Suddenly the sandy plain over which we
were travelling, seemed to sink away in front of us, and at the
bottom of a steep dip we could see clumps of <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>tamarisk
looming through the storm.&nbsp; We knew that a refuge was at
hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Here then we are comfortably housed under one of these bushes,
where there is a delightful lull.&nbsp; The soil is all deep
sand, white as snow, and the tent which we have rigged up is
already half buried in it, so that we might imagine ourselves at
home snowed up on Boxing Day.&nbsp; We have made a fire of tarfa
sticks inside the tent, and have been enjoying Hanna&rsquo;s
delicious coffee.&nbsp; Where is one ever so much at home as in
one&rsquo;s own tent?&nbsp; Awwad surprised us very much to-day
by objecting, when we proposed to pitch the tent, that it would
be impossible to do so in the sand.&nbsp; If Mohammed or any of
the townspeople had done so it would have been natural, but Awwad
is a Bedouin born, and must have pitched camp hundreds of times
in the Nef&uacute;d.&nbsp; Yet he had never heard of burying a
tent peg.</p>
<p>One misfortune has happened in the storm.&nbsp; The old rogue
of a camel we bought at Mez&aacute;rib, who has been trying all
along to get back to his family, has given us the slip.&nbsp;
Taking advantage of the darkness, and knowing that the wind would
obliterate his track at once, he decamped as soon as unloaded,
and is gone.&nbsp; Mohammed and Awwad, each on a del&uacute;l,
are scouring the country, but without a chance of finding him;
for at best they can only see things a hundred yards off, and he
was not missed for the first half hour.&nbsp; Mohammed has vowed
to kill a lamb, but I fear that will do no good.</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span><i>December</i> 27.&mdash;We have arrived at K&acirc;f
after a long march, twenty-seven or twenty-eight miles.&nbsp;
Course about south-east!</p>
<p>In the night a little rain fell, and the wind moderated.&nbsp;
At eight o&rsquo;clock we started, crossing a wide plain of
coarse sand interspersed with low sandstone tells.&nbsp; At noon
we came upon a well-marked track, the road of the salt caravans
between Bozra and K&acirc;f, which, after crossing a rather high
ridge, brought us to a very curious valley; an offshoot, we were
told, of the Wady Sirh&aacute;n.&nbsp; The geological formation
of this is singular; the crest of the ridge on either side the
valley is of black rock with detached stones of the
same&mdash;then yellow sandstone, then another black layer, then
pure sand, then sand with isolated black stones, then a
calcareous deposit, and at the bottom chalk.&nbsp; The actual bed
of the wady is a fine white sand sprinkled over with tamarisk and
guttub bushes.&nbsp; As we were crossing this our dogs started a
jerboa, and, little creature though it is, it gave them much
trouble to catch it.&nbsp; Its hops were prodigious, and from
side to side and backwards and forwards, so that the dogs always
ran over it, and snatching, always missed it; till at last, as if
by accident, it jumped into Shiekhah&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp;
Abdallah and the rest were very anxious to eat it, but it was so
mauled as to be beyond cooking.&nbsp; At three o&rsquo;clock we
crested another ridge, and from it suddenly came in sight of the
great Wady Sirh&aacute;n, the object of so many of <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>our
conjectures.&nbsp; It seems, however, to be no wady, but the bed
of an ancient sea.&nbsp; A little black dot on the edge of a
<i>subbka</i> or salt lake, now dry, and just under a tall black
tell, marked the oasis of K&acirc;f, an infinitesimal village of
sixteen houses, and a palm garden of about an acre.</p>
<p>I have had the misfortune to sprain my knee, an awkward
accident, and very annoying in the middle of a journey.&nbsp; My
del&uacute;l, always a fidgety animal, gave a bolt just as I was
leaning over to arrange something on the off side of the
<i>shed&aacute;d</i>, or saddle, and pitched me off.&nbsp; The
pain is indescribable, and I fear I shall be helplessly lame for
some time to come.&nbsp; But here we are at K&acirc;f.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 28.&mdash;K&acirc;f is a pretty little
village, with a character of its own, quite distinct from
anything one sees in Syria.&nbsp; All is in miniature, the
sixteen little square houses, the little battlemented towers and
battlemented walls seven feet high&mdash;seventy or eighty palm
trees in a garden watered from wells, and some trees I took at
first for cypresses, but which turned out to be a very delicate
kind of tamarisk. <a name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84"
class="citation">[84]</a>&nbsp; Though so small a place,
K&acirc;f has a singularly flourishing look, all is neat there
and in good repair, not a battlement broken or a door off its
hinges, as would certainly have been the case in Syria.&nbsp;
There are also a good many young palms planted in among the older
ones, and young fig trees and vines, things hardly ever found in
the North.&nbsp; The people are nice looking <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>and well
behaved, though at first they startled us a little by going about
all of them with swords in their hands.&nbsp; These they hold
either sloped over their shoulders or grasped in both hands by
the scabbard, much as one sees in the old stone figures of
medi&aelig;val martyrs, or in the effigies of crusaders.</p>
<p>Abdallah el-Kamis, Sheykh of the village, to whom we had
letters from Huseyn, received us with great politeness; and a
room in his house was swept out for our use.&nbsp; Like all the
other rooms, it opened on to the court-yard, in the middle of
which was tethered a two-year-old colt.&nbsp; Our room had been a
storing place for wood, and was without furniture of any sort,
but we were delighted to find also without inhabitants.&nbsp; The
architecture here is very simple, plain mud walls with no windows
or openings of any kind except a few square holes near the
roof.&nbsp; The roof was of <i>ithel</i> beams with cross rafters
of palm, thatched in with palm branches.&nbsp; The principal room
is called the kahwah or coffee room; and in it there is a square
hearth at the side or in the middle for coffee-making.&nbsp;
There is no chimney, and the smoke escapes as it can; but this is
not so uncomfortable as it sounds, for the wood burnt here burns
with a beautiful bright flame, giving out a maximum of heat to a
minimum of smoke.&nbsp; It is the <i>ratha</i> or <i>ghada</i>.
<a name="citation85"></a><a href="#footnote85"
class="citation">[85]</a>&nbsp; People sit round the hearth while
coffee is being made, a solemn process occupying nearly half an
hour.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>As soon
as we arrived, a trencher of dates was brought, dates of the last
year&rsquo;s crop, all sticky and mashed up, but good; and later
in the evening, we had a more regular dinner of burghul and
boiled fowls.&nbsp; We are much struck with the politeness of
everybody.&nbsp; Abdallah, our host, asked us at least twenty
times after our health before he would go on to anything else;
and it was not easy to find appropriate compliments in
return.&nbsp; Everything of course is very poor and very simple,
but one cannot help feeling that one is among civilized
people.&nbsp; They have been making a great fuss with Mohammed,
who is treated as a sheykh.&nbsp; Tudmur is well known by name,
and at this distance is considered an important town.&nbsp; Much
surprise was expressed at finding a man of his rank in the
semi-menial position Mohammed holds with us, and he was put to
some polite cross-questioning in the evening as to the motive of
his journey.&nbsp; No Franjis have ever been seen at K&acirc;f
before, so the people say; and they do not understand the respect
in which Europeans are held elsewhere.&nbsp; Mohammed, however,
has explained his &ldquo;brotherhood with the Beg,&rdquo; and
protested that his journey is one of honour, not of profit; so
that we are treated with as much courtesy as if we were Arabs
born.&nbsp; Awwad the Shammar has been of great use to us, as he
is well known here, and he serves as an introduction.</p>
<p>K&acirc;f is quite independent of the Sultan, though it has
twice been sacked by Turkish soldiers, once <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>under Ibrahim
Pasha in 1834, and again only a few years ago, when the
Government of Damascus sent a military expedition down the Wady
Sirh&aacute;n.&nbsp; We were shown the ruins of a castle, Kasr
es-Sa&iuml;d, on a hill above the town which the former
destroyed, and we heard much lamentation over the proceedings of
the latter.&nbsp; The inhabitants of K&acirc;f acknowledge
themselves subjects of Ibn Rashid, the Jebel Shammar chief, some
of whose people were here only a few days since, taking the
annual tribute, a very small sum, twenty mejidies (&pound;4),
which they are glad to pay in return for his protection.&nbsp;
They are very enthusiastic about &ldquo;the Emir,&rdquo; as they
call him, and certainly have no reason to wish for annexation to
Syria.&nbsp; The little town of K&acirc;f and its neighbour
Itheri, where we now are, have commercially more connection with
the north than with the south, for their principal wealth, such
as it is, arises from the salt trade with Bozra.&nbsp; Abdallah
el-Kamis seems to be well off, for he possesses several slaves,
and has more than one wife.&nbsp; But the colt I have mentioned
is his only four-footed possession; he would have come with us,
he said, if he had owned a del&uacute;l.&nbsp; I noticed a few
camels and donkeys and goats about the village.</p>
<p>Makbul, the Kreysheh, has gone back, and we now want to find a
Sher&aacute;ri to take us on to J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; We have come on
to Itheri, K&acirc;f&rsquo;s twin oasis, two and a half hours
east of it, also in the Wady Sirh&aacute;n.&nbsp; This is not
marked on many of the modern <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>maps, though Chesney has it
incorrectly placed on his.&nbsp; We find by the barometer that
they are both on the same level, so that our conjecture seems
confirmed, about the Wady Sirh&aacute;n having no slope.&nbsp;
The Wady Sirh&aacute;n is a curious chaotic depression, probably
the bed of some ancient sea like the Dead Sea, and is here about
twelve miles broad if we can judge by the hills we see beyond it,
and which are no doubt the opposite cliffs of the basin.&nbsp;
There are numerous wells both here and at K&acirc;f, wide and
shallow, for the water is only eight feet below the surface of
the ground.&nbsp; From these the palm gardens are
irrigated.&nbsp; There are wells too outside, all lying low and
at the same level.&nbsp; The water is drinkable, by no means
excellent.&nbsp; We crossed a large salt lake, now dry, where the
salt is gathered for the caravans.</p>
<p>On our road Mohammed entertained us with tales of his birth
and ancestry.&nbsp; The people of K&acirc;f have heard of the Ibn
Ar&ucirc;ks, and have told Mohammed that he will find relations
in many parts of Arabia besides J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; They say there
is somebody at Bereydeh, and a certain Ibn Homeydi, whom Mohammed
has heard of as a cousin.&nbsp; Then here at Itheri, the
Sheykh&rsquo;s wife is a member of the J&ocirc;f family.&nbsp;
Everything in fact seems going just as we expected it.</p>
<p>Itheri is a still smaller place than K&acirc;f but it boasts
of an ancient building and miniature castle inside the walls,
something after the fashion of the Hauran houses.&nbsp; This,
instead of mud, the common <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>Arab material, is built of black
stones, well squared and regularly placed.&nbsp; On the lintel of
the doorway there is or rather has been, an inscription in some
ancient character, perhaps Himyaritic, which we would have copied
had it been legible, but the weather has almost effaced it. <a
name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89"
class="citation">[89]</a>&nbsp; Here we are being entertained by
Jeruan, an untidy half-witted young man, with long hair in plaits
and a face like a Scotch terrier, who is the son of Merzuga,
Mohammed&rsquo;s cousin, and consequently a cousin himself.&nbsp;
Though nothing much to be proud of as a relation, we find him an
attentive host.&nbsp; His mother is an intelligent and well-bred
woman, and it seems strange that she should have so inferior a
son.&nbsp; Her other three sons, for Jeruan is the eldest of
four, have their wits like other people, but they are kept in the
background.&nbsp; Merzuga came to see me just now with a large
dish of dates in her hand, and stopped to talk.&nbsp; Her face is
still attractive, and she must have once been extremely
beautiful.&nbsp; I notice that she wears a number of silver rings
on her fingers like wedding rings.</p>
<p>Merzuga tells us we shall find plenty of Ibn Ar&ucirc;k
relations at J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; She herself left it young and talks
of it as an earthly paradise from which she has been torn to live
in this wretched little oasis.&nbsp; Itheri is indeed a forlorn
place, all except Jeruan&rsquo;s palm garden.&nbsp; After a walk
in the palm garden, in which <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>my lameness prevented me from
joining, we all sat down to a very good dinner of lamb and sopped
bread&mdash;the bread tasted like excellent pastry&mdash;served
us by Jeruan in person, standing according to Arab fashion when
guests are eating.&nbsp; His mother looks well after him, and
tells him what to do, and it is evident, though he has the sense
to say very little, that he is looked upon as not quite
&ldquo;accountable&rdquo; in his family.&nbsp; Wilfrid describes
the walk in the garden as rather amusing, Mohammed and Abdallah
making long speeches of compliments about all they saw, and
telling Jeruan&rsquo;s head man extraordinary stories of the
grandeur and wealth of Tudmur.&nbsp; Jeruan&rsquo;s garden, the
only one at Itheri, contains four hundred palm trees, many of
them newly planted, and none more than twenty-five years
old.&nbsp; Amongst them was a young tree of the
<i>h&eacute;llua</i> variety, the sweet date of J&ocirc;f,
imported from thence, and considered here a great rarity.&nbsp;
At this there was a chorus of admiration.&nbsp; The ithel trees
were also much admired.&nbsp; They are grown for timber, and
spring from the stub when cut down, a six years&rsquo; growth
being already twenty feet high.</p>
<p>Two men have arrived from J&ocirc;f with the welcome news that
all is well between this and J&ocirc;f; that is, there are no
Arabs yet in the Wady Sirh&aacute;n; welcome because we have no
introductions, and a meeting might be disagreeable.&nbsp; The
season is so late and the pasture so bad, that the Wady has <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>been quite
deserted since last spring.&nbsp; There will be no road now, or
track of any kind, and as it is at least two hundred miles to
J&ocirc;f, we must have a guide to shew us the wells.&nbsp; Such
a one we have found in a funny looking little Bedouin, a
Sher&aacute;ri, who happens to be here and who will go with us
for ten mejidies.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 29.&mdash;There was a bitter east wind blowing
when we started this morning, and I observed a peewit, like a
land bird at sea, flying hither and thither under the lea of the
palm trees, looking hopeless and worn out with its long
voyage.&nbsp; Poor thing, it will die here, for there is nothing
such a bird can eat anywhere for hundreds of miles.&nbsp; It must
have been blown out of its reckoning, perhaps from the
Euphrates.</p>
<p>Our course to-day lay along the edge of the Wady, sometimes
crossing stony promontories from the upper plain, sometimes sandy
inlets from the Wady.&nbsp; The heights of these were always
pretty much the same, 2250 feet above and 1850 below&mdash;so
these may be taken as the respective heights of the Ham&aacute;d
and of the Wady Sirh&aacute;n.&nbsp; There are besides, here and
there, isolated tells, three hundred to four hundred feet higher
than either.&nbsp; Rough broken ground all day, principally of
sand with slaty grit sprinkled over it, the vegetation very
scanty on the high ground, but richer in the hollows.&nbsp; In
one small winding ravine leading into the Wady, we found ghada
trees, but otherwise nothing bigger than <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>shrubs.&nbsp;
There Awwad told us that two years ago he was robbed and stripped
by a ghaz&uacute; from the Hauran.&nbsp; He had lost six camels
and all he possessed.&nbsp; The Haurani were eight in number, his
own party six.&nbsp; I asked him how it was the robbers got the
best of it.&nbsp; He said it was &ldquo;min Allah&rdquo; (from
God).&nbsp; The Wady Sirh&aacute;n seems to be a favourite place
for robbers, and Awwad takes the occurrence as a matter of
course.&nbsp; I asked him why he had left his tribe, the Shammar,
and come to live so far north as Salkhad.&nbsp; He said it was
&ldquo;<i>nas&iacute;b</i>,&rdquo; a thing fated; that he had
married a Salkhad wife, and she would not go away from her
people.&nbsp; I asked him how he earned his living, and he
laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have got half a mare,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and a del&uacute;l, and I make ghaz&uacute;s.&nbsp; There
are nine of us Shammar in the Hauran, and we go out together
towards Zerka, or to the western Leja and take cattle by
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then showed us some frightful scars of
wounds, which he had got on these occasions, and made Wilfrid
feel a bullet which was still sticking in his side.&nbsp; He is a
curious creature, but we like him, and, robber or no robber, he
has quite the air of a gentleman.&nbsp; He is besides an
agreeable companion, sings very well, recites ballads, and is a
great favourite everywhere.&nbsp; At K&acirc;f and Itheri he was
hugged and kissed by the men, old and young, and welcomed by the
women in every house.</p>
<p>We were nearly frozen all the morning, the wind <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>piercing
through our fur cloaks.&nbsp; At half-past twelve, after four
hours&rsquo; marching, we came to some wells called
Kur&aacute;ghir, six of them in a bare hollow, with camel tracks
leading from every point of the compass towards them.&nbsp; It is
clear that at some time of the year the Wady is inhabited; Awwad
says by the Roala in winter, but this year there is nobody.&nbsp;
The water, like that of K&acirc;f and Itheri, is slightly
brackish.&nbsp; Near Kur&aacute;ghir we saw some gazelles and
coursed them vainly.&nbsp; It is vexatious, for I have forgotten
to bring meat, and unless we can catch or shoot something, we
shall have none till we get to J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; I ought to have
thought of it, for, though provisions are by no means plentiful
at Itheri, we could probably have bought a sheep and driven it on
with us.&nbsp; The pain of my lameness distracted my
attention&mdash;a bad excuse, but the only one.&nbsp; I suffer
less when riding than at any other time.</p>
<p>We are now, since four o&rsquo;clock, camped on the sand under
some ghada bushes, and the wind has dropped for the moment.&nbsp;
It seems always to blow here except for an hour about sunset and
another at dawn.&nbsp; We are to dine on beef tea, burghul with
curry sauce, and a water-melon, the last of our Hauran store.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 30.&mdash;On the high level all the morning
over ground like the Harra with volcanic stones, a fierce
south-east wind in our faces, so that we could not talk or hardly
think.&nbsp; Our course lay <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>towards an inhospitable looking range
of hills called El Mizmeh, and when we reached these, to the
right of them, for we travel in anything but a straight
line.&nbsp; Saw great numbers of red locusts which, as the sun
warmed the ground, began to fly about and were pursued by the men
and knocked down with sticks.&nbsp; Enough have been secured to
make a dish for dinner.&nbsp; When flying, these insects look
very like large May flies, as they have the same helpless heavy
flight, drifting down the wind with hardly sufficient power of
direction to keep them clear of obstacles.&nbsp; Sometimes they
fly right against the camels, and at others drop heavily into the
bushes where they are easily caught.&nbsp; When sitting on the
ground, however, they are hard to see, and they keep a good
look-out and jump up and drift away again as you come near
them.&nbsp; They seem to have more sense, than power of
moving.</p>
<p>At two we came to more wells,&mdash;Mahiyeh&mdash;most of them
choked up with sand, but one containing a sufficient supply of
brackish water.&nbsp; These wells lay among clumps of tamarisk,
out of which we started several hares which the greyhounds could
not catch, as they always dodged back to cover.&nbsp; Wilfrid and
I waited behind for this fruitless hunting upon which our dinner
depended, and did not join the rest of the party for more than a
mile.&nbsp; Before we reached them we came upon Hanna, sitting on
the ground on his <i>hed&ucirc;m</i> (quilt and abba), and
Ibrahim standing over him, both shouting, &ldquo;<i>Wah</i>!
<i>wah</i>! <i>wah</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>We could not conceive what had
happened and could get no information from either of them, except
that they were going to remain where they were.&nbsp; These two
townspeople sitting on their beds all alone in the Wady
Sirh&aacute;n were so absurd a spectacle that, at the moment, we
could not help laughing; but it was not an affair for laughter,
and of course it was impossible to leave them there.&nbsp; We
insisted on an explanation.&nbsp; There had been a quarrel
between Hanna and Abdallah, because the latter had driven on
Hanna&rsquo;s del&uacute;l fast with the other camels, and
refused to let it be made to kneel down and get up again.&nbsp;
Abdallah and Awwab were in a great hurry to get as far from
Mahiyeh as possible, because Hamd&aacute;n the Sher&acirc;ri says
it is a dangerous spot.&nbsp; But Hanna was angry, and in his
anger he dropped his cloak; upon which he jumped down, pulling
his bed after him, and sat down on the ground.&nbsp; There the
others left him, wailing and raving, and in this state we found
him.&nbsp; He proposed that he and Ibrahim should be left behind
to be eaten up by the hyena whose tracks we had seen.&nbsp;
However, Ibrahim, who had only stayed to keep him company, was
quite ready to go on, and, seeing this, Hanna was not long in
getting up, and, making his brother carry his bedding, he
followed us.&nbsp; It was no good inquiring who was right or who
was wrong; we stopped the camels, and, driving back the
del&uacute;l insisted on Hanna&rsquo;s mounting, which after some
faces he did, and the episode <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>ended.&nbsp; Mohammed has been
commissioned to insist with the Arabs on peace, and we have we
think prevailed with Hanna to bear no malice.&nbsp; It is
absolutely impossible for anybody to go back now without losing
his life, and I trust they will all be reasonable; it is
disagreeable to think that there has been discord in our small
party, separated as it is from all the rest of the world.&nbsp;
We are camped now in a side wady where the camel pasture is
good.&nbsp; We saw the place from a great distance, for we are
becoming skilful now at guessing likely spots.&nbsp; Wherever you
see rocky ground in lines you may be sure pasture will be
found.&nbsp; We have seen no sign of recent habitation in the
country since leaving Itheri, neither footprint of camel nor of
man.</p>
<p>The locusts fried are fairly good to eat.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 31.&mdash;Another long day&rsquo;s march, and
here we are at the end of the year in one of the most desolate
places in the world.&nbsp; It was so cold last night, that all
the locusts are dead.&nbsp; They are lying about everywhere, and
being eaten up by the little desert birds, larks, and
wheatears.&nbsp; We have got down again into the main bed of the
Wady Sirh&aacute;n, which is still at the same level as before;
it is here nearly flat, and covered with great bunches of guttub
and other shrubs, all very salt to the taste; the soil crumbly
and unsound, in places white with saltpetre.&nbsp; Awwad and the
Sher&acirc;ri declare that there are quicksands,
<i>had&ocirc;da</i> (literally, <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>an abyss), somewhere in the
neighbourhood, in which everything that passes over sinks and
disappears, leaving no trace&mdash;men, camels, and gazelles; but
of such we saw nothing.&nbsp; Coasting the edge of the Wady, we
came suddenly on some gazelles, which led us to higher ground,
where we found a stony wilderness of the Harra type; and amongst
the stones we saw a hyena trotting leisurely.&nbsp; We got
nothing, however; neither him nor the gazelles, and are still
without meat.&nbsp; No other incident occurred till we came to a
palm tree standing by itself in an open place; near it, a
charming little spring, quite in among the roots of a thick clump
of palm bushes.&nbsp; The hole is about three feet across, and
two deep, with about a foot of water in it; the water rises again
as fast as it is taken out, but never overflows.&nbsp; There were
traces of hyenas and gazelles about, and this, I suppose, is
where the desert animals come to drink, for it is the only water
above ground we have yet seen.&nbsp; This spring is called
Maasreh (little by little)&mdash;a pleasant spot where we should
have liked to camp; but it is always dangerous to stop near
water, lest people should come.&nbsp; Awwad says there is some
tradition of a town or village having formerly existed here; but
no ruins are to be seen.&nbsp; The water is sweet and good, as
might be perceived by the insects which were swimming about in
it.&nbsp; The Arabs always judge of the wholesomeness of water in
this way.&nbsp; There is nothing more suspicious in the <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>desert than
perfectly clear water, free from animal life.</p>
<p>We are now camped under a low cliff hollowed out into caves as
if by water, capital dens for hy&aelig;nas.&nbsp; There is a
beautiful view looking back at the Mizmeh hills.&nbsp; The
evening is still and cold, but we do not like to make much fire
for fear of enemies.&nbsp; Hamd&aacute;n, our Sher&aacute;ri
guide, an uncouth, savage creature to look at, has been reciting
a very pretty ballad, which he tells us he made himself.&nbsp; It
is in stanzas of four lines with alternate rhymes, and relates to
an episode in his own family.&nbsp; As he recited it the rest of
the Arabs chimed in, repeating always the last word of the line
with the rhyming syllable; it had a good effect.&nbsp; The story
was simple, and told how Hamd&aacute;n&rsquo;s mother and sister
had a quarrel, and how they brought their grievances before Obeyd
ibn Rashid at Ha&iuml;l, and how the old Sheykh settled it by
putting a rope round the daughter&rsquo;s neck, and bidding the
mother hold the end of it, and do so for the rest of their
days.&nbsp; Whereupon the daughter had kissed her mother, and
Obeyd had sent them away with presents, a del&uacute;l, a cloak
each, and a hundred measures of wheat, a present he had continued
giving them every year till he died, and which is given still by
his nephew, Mohammed, the present ruler of Jebel Shammar.&nbsp;
Hamd&aacute;n has also given us an interesting account of the
Ha&iuml;l politics, which agrees very closely with what we
remember of Mr. Palgrave&rsquo;s, carrying them on to <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>a later
date.&nbsp; The present Ibn Rashid is not by any means so amiable
a character as his brother Tell&aacute;l; and
Hamd&aacute;n&rsquo;s account of his career is rather
startling.&nbsp; It appears that he has put to death something
like a dozen of his relations, and is more feared than loved by
the Shammar.&nbsp; This is very tiresome, as it may be a reason
for our not going on to Nejd after all.&nbsp; But we shall hear
more when we get to J&ocirc;f.</p>
<p>Hamd&aacute;n&rsquo;s recitative was, as nearly as I could
write the musical part of it, like this:&mdash;</p>

</a></p>
<p><i>January</i> 1, 1879.&mdash;A black frost, but still.&nbsp;
We have changed our course, and have been going all day nearly
due south&mdash;twenty-five miles, as near as we can calculate
it&mdash;and down the middle of the Wady Sirh&aacute;n, a level
plain of sand and grit, with here and there mounds of pure white
sand covered with ghada.&nbsp; Our plan is to get up and strike
the tents at the first glimpse of dawn, drink a cup of coffee,
and eat a biscuit or a bit of rusk (k&acirc;k), and then march on
till three or four in the afternoon without stopping for an
instant, eating half-a-dozen dates and some more rusk as we
go.&nbsp; Then immediately on stopping, and before the tents are
pitched, we light a fire and make coffee, which carries us on <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>till dinner
is ready, about sunset.&nbsp; It is wonderful how little food one
can do with while travelling.&nbsp; We have had no meat now for
the last four days till to-day, only beef tea, and burghul, and
dates, with sometimes fried onions, or flour mixed with curry
powder and butter, and baked into a cake.&nbsp; This last is very
good, and easily made.&nbsp; To-day, however, we are in clover,
as the dogs coursed a hare, and we dug her out.&nbsp; The desert
hare is very little bigger than a large rabbit, and is literally
too much for one, and not enough for two; but Mohammed
magnanimously foregoes his portion, and says he can wait.</p>
<p>Mohammed has been improving the occasion of a dispute which
arose this evening on a choice of camp, to tell us some stories
of his own adventures in the desert; and we have been telling him
ours.&nbsp; He had a younger brother, whom his mother was very
fond of, a regular town boy with &ldquo;a white face like a
girl,&rdquo; who knew how to read and write and knew nothing of
the desert (Mohammed himself like his great namesake, has always
been a camel driver).&nbsp; Now at Tudmur they have constantly
had fights and quarrels for the Sheykhat, and on one such
occasion his brother was sent away by his parents to Sokhne, the
neighbouring village, about thirty miles from Tudmur; and there
he stayed for some time with a relation.&nbsp; At last, however,
he got tired of being away from home, and wanted to see his
mother.&nbsp; He started off with another boy of his own age
(about fifteen) to walk back to Tudmur.&nbsp; <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>It was in
the middle of summer, and they lost their way and wandered far
down into the Ham&aacute;d where they died of thirst.&nbsp;
Mohammed had gone out to look for them, and found them both dead
close together.</p>
<p>On another occasion Mohammed himself was nearly meeting his
death.&nbsp; He had gone alone with his camels on the road to
Karieteyn, and had fallen in with a ghaz&uacute; of robbers from
the hills.&nbsp; These stripped him of everything except his
shirt and a tarbush.&nbsp; His gun he had contrived to hide under
a bush, but they left him nothing else, neither food nor water,
and it was in the middle of summer.&nbsp; Karieteyn, the nearest
place, was about forty miles off, and he was lame with a blow he
had received.&nbsp; However, when the robbers were gone, he set
out in that direction, and managed to walk on till night and the
next day, till he got to a ruin called Kasr el Hayr where he fell
down senseless under the shade, and lay for twenty-four hours
unable to move, and suffering agonies from thirst.&nbsp; At last,
when he had said to himself, &ldquo;now I shall have to
die,&rdquo; a party of camel men from Sokhne came by and found
him lying there.&nbsp; At first they took him for a slave, for
the sun had burnt him black, and his tongue was dried so that he
could not speak.&nbsp; Fortunately one of the party recognised
him, and then they gave him water.&nbsp; He still could give no
account of himself, but they put him on a donkey and brought him
with them to Tudmur.</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>Our
own story was the one of our quarrel with Abunjad and our rush
from Akaba to Gaza, when we so nearly perished of thirst.</p>
<p>The year would have begun prosperously, but for a severe cold
Wilfrid has caught.&nbsp; He has lost his voice.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 2.&mdash;A hard frost&mdash;water frozen in the
pail.&nbsp; Reached the wells of Shaybeh at half-past eight and
watered the camels&mdash;water very brackish&mdash;level by
aneroid 1950, depth to surface of water twelve feet.&nbsp; Got
into a sort of track, part of the morning, but one evidently not
frequented.&nbsp; At one o&rsquo;clock came to another well, near
a curious rock which at first we took for a castle.&nbsp; We have
now crossed the wady and are on its western bank.&nbsp; Passed a
ruined house of no great antiquity called Abu Kasr and another
well near it, and at half-past four have encamped under some sand
hills, crowned with ghada, a delightful spot not far from a
fourth well called Bir el-Jerawi&mdash;level by barometer
1840.&nbsp; Wilfrid has recovered his voice but still has a bad
cold.&nbsp; I am as lame as ever, though in less pain.&nbsp; I
sometimes think I shall never be able to walk again.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, <i>January</i> 3.&mdash;We have had an
adventure at last and a disagreeable one; a severe lesson as to
the danger of encamping near wells.&nbsp; We started early, but
were delayed a whole hour at Jerawi taking water, and did not
leave the wells till nearly eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Then we
turned back nearly due east across the wady.&nbsp; The soil of
pure white <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>sand was heavy going, and we went slowly, crossing low
undulations without other landmark than the tells we had left
behind us.&nbsp; Here and there rose little mounds tufted with
ghada.&nbsp; To one of these Wilfrid and I cantered on, leaving
the camels behind us, and dismounting, tied our mares to the
bushes that we might enjoy a few minutes&rsquo; rest, and eat our
midday mouthful&mdash;the greyhounds meanwhile played about and
chased each other in the sand.&nbsp; We had finished, and were
talking of I know not what, when the camels passed us.&nbsp; They
were hardly a couple of hundred yards in front when suddenly we
heard a thud, thud, thud on the sand, a sound of galloping.&nbsp;
Wilfrid jumped to his feet, looked round and called out,
&ldquo;Get on your mare.&nbsp; This is a
ghaz&uacute;.&rdquo;&nbsp; As I scrambled round the bush to my
mare I saw a troop of horsemen charging down at full gallop with
their lances, not two hundred yards off.&nbsp; Wilfrid was up as
he spoke, and so should I have been, but for my sprained knee and
the deep sand, both of which gave way as I was rising.&nbsp; I
fell back.&nbsp; There was no time to think and I had hardly
struggled to my feet, when the enemy was upon us, and I was
knocked down by a spear.&nbsp; Then they all turned on Wilfrid,
who had waited for me, some of them jumping down on foot to get
hold of his mare&rsquo;s halter.&nbsp; He had my gun with him,
which I had just before handed to him, but unloaded; his own gun
and his sword being on his del&uacute;l.&nbsp; He fortunately had
on very thick clothes, two abbas one over the other, and <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>English
clothes underneath, so the lances did him no harm.&nbsp; At last
his assailants managed to get his gun from him and broke it over
his head, hitting him three times and smashing the stock.&nbsp;
Resistance seemed to me useless, and I shouted to the nearest
horseman, &ldquo;<i>ana dah&iacute;lak</i>&rdquo; (I am under
your protection), the usual form of surrender.&nbsp; Wilfrid
hearing this, and thinking he had had enough of this unequal
contest, one against twelve, threw himself off his mare.&nbsp;
The <i>khayal</i> (horsemen) having seized both the mares,
paused, and as soon as they had gathered breath, began to ask us
who we were and where we came from.&nbsp; &ldquo;English, and we
have come from Damascus,&rdquo; we replied, &ldquo;and our camels
are close by.&nbsp; Come with us, and you shall hear about
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our caravan, while all this had happened, and it
only lasted about five minutes, had formed itself into a square
and the camels were kneeling down, as we could plainly see from
where we were.&nbsp; I hardly expected the horsemen to do as we
asked, but the man who seemed to be their leader at once let us
walk on (a process causing me acute pain), and followed with the
others to the caravan.&nbsp; We found Mohammed and the rest of
our party entrenched behind the camels with their guns pointed,
and as we approached, Mohammed stepped out and came
forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Min entum?&rdquo; (who are you?) was the
first question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Roala min Ibn Debaa.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wallah? will you swear by God?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wallah!
we swear.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mohammed ibn Ar&ucirc;k of Tudmur.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wallah?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wallah!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And these are Franjis travelling with you?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wallah!&nbsp; Franjis, friends of Ibn Shaalan.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>It
was all right, we had fallen into the hands of friends.&nbsp; Ibn
Shaalan, our host of last year, was bound to protect us, even so
far away in the desert, and none of his people dared meddle with
us, knowing this.&nbsp; Besides, Mohammed was a Tudmuri, and as
such could not be molested by Roala, for Tudmur pays tribute to
Ibn Shaalan, and the Tudmuris have a right to his
protection.&nbsp; So, as soon as the circumstances were made
clear, orders were given by the chief of the party to his
followers to bring back our mares, and the gun, and everything
which had been dropped in the scuffle.&nbsp; Even to
Wilfrid&rsquo;s tobacco bag, all was restored.&nbsp; The young
fellows who had taken the mares made rather wry faces, bitterly
lamenting their bad fortune in finding us friends.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah the beautiful mares,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;and the
beautiful gun.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Arabs are always good-humoured,
whatever else their faults, and presently we were all on very
good terms, sitting in a circle on the sand, eating dates and
passing round the pipe of peace.&nbsp; They were now our
guests.</p>
<p>What struck us as strange in all this was, the ready good
faith with which they believed every word we said.&nbsp; We had
spoken the truth, but why did they trust us?&nbsp; They knew
neither us nor Mohammed; yet they had taken our word that we were
<a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>friends,
when they might so easily have ridden off without question with
our property.&nbsp; Nobody would ever have heard of it, or known
who they were.</p>
<p>It appears that Ibn Debaa (hy&aelig;na), the Sheykh, and his
friends were a small party in advance of the main body of the
Roala.&nbsp; They had come on to see what pasturage there might
be in the wady, and had there camped only a few miles from the
wells of El Jerawi near which we slept last night.&nbsp; They had
come in the morning for water, and had seen our tracks in the
sand, and so had followed, riding in hot haste to overtake
us.&nbsp; It was a mere accident their finding us separated from
the rest of the caravan, and they had charged down as soon as
they saw us.&nbsp; Everything depends on rapidity in these
attacks, and this had been quite successful The least hesitation
on their part, and we should have been safe with our
camels.&nbsp; There they could not have molested us, for though
they were twelve to our eight, they had only lances, while we
carried firearms.&nbsp; We liked the look of these young
Roala.&nbsp; In spite of their rough behaviour, we could see that
they were gentlemen.&nbsp; They were very much ashamed of having
used their spears against me, and made profuse apologies; they
only saw a person wearing a cloak, and never suspected but that
it belonged to a man.&nbsp; Indeed their mistake is not a matter
for surprise, for they were so out of breath and excited with
their gallop, that they looked at nothing except the object of
their desire&mdash;the mares.&nbsp; The loss of <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>these,
however, I fear, was to them a cause of greater sorrow than the
rough handling to which we had been treated, when, after
explanations given and regrets interchanged, they rode
away.&nbsp; Mohammed was anxious not to detain them, prudently
considering that our acquaintance with them had gone far enough,
and it was plain that Awwad was in a terrible fidget.&nbsp; I
fancy he has a good many debts of blood owing him, and is
somewhat shy of strangers.&nbsp; The others, too, were rather
subdued and silent; so we wished Ibn Debaa farewell and let him
go.</p>
<p>The mares belonging to this ghaz&uacute; were small, compact,
and active, with especially good shoulders and fine heads, but
they were of a more poneyish type than our own &Aacute;nazeh
mares.&nbsp; Most of them were bay.&nbsp; One I saw was ridden in
a bit.</p>
<p>When the Roala were gone we compared notes.&nbsp; In the first
place, Wilfrid&rsquo;s hurts were examined, but they are only
contusions.&nbsp; The thick rope he wears round his head had
received all the blows, and though the stock of the gun is clean
broken, steel and all, his head is still sound.&nbsp; The lances
could not get through his clothes.&nbsp; As regards myself the
only injury I have received is the renewal of my sprain.&nbsp;
But I could almost forget the pain of it in my anger at it, as
being the cause of our being caught.&nbsp; But for this we might
have galloped away to our camels and received the enemy in quite
another fashion.&nbsp; I was asked if I was not frightened, but
in fact there was at first no time, and afterwards rage swallowed
<a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>up every
other feeling.&nbsp; Wilfrid says, but I do not believe him, that
he felt frightened, and was very near running away and leaving
me, but on reflection stayed.&nbsp; The affair seems more
alarming now it is over, which is perhaps natural.</p>
<p>As to the others, Mohammed is terribly crestfallen at the not
very heroic part he took in the action.&nbsp; The purely
defensive attitude of the caravan was no doubt prudent; but it
seemed hardly up to the ideal of chivalry Mohammed has always
professed.&nbsp; He keeps on reproaching himself, but we tell him
that he did quite right.&nbsp; It was certainly our own fault
that we were surprised in this way, and if the enemy, as they
might have been, had really been robbers and outlaws, our safety
depended on our having the caravan intact as a fortress to return
to after being robbed.&nbsp; To have rushed forward in disorder
to help us would have exposed the whole caravan to a defeat,
which in so desolate a region as this would mean nothing less
than dying of cold and starvation.</p>
<p>We may indeed be very thankful that matters were no
worse.&nbsp; I shall never again dismount while I remain
crippled, and never as long as I live, will I tie my horse to a
bush.</p>
<p>Many vows of sheep, it appears, were made by all the party of
spectators during the action, so we are to have a feast at
J&ocirc;f&mdash;if ever we get there.</p>
<p>Now all is quiet, and Hamd&aacute;n the Sher&acirc;ri is
singing the loves of a young man and maiden who <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>were
separated from one another by mischief-makers, and afterwards
managed to carry on a correspondence by tying their letters to
their goats when these went out to pasture</p>
<p><i>January</i> 4.&mdash;There was no dawdling this morning,
for everybody has become serious, and we were off by seven, and
have marched steadily on for quite thirty miles without stopping,
at the rate of three-and-a-half miles an hour.&nbsp; We have left
the Wady Sirh&aacute;n for good, and are making a straight cut
across the Ham&aacute;d for J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; There is no water
this way, but less chance of ghaz&uacute;s.&nbsp; The soil has
been a light hard gravel, with hardly a plant or an inequality to
interfere with the camels&rsquo; pace.&nbsp; At one o&rsquo;clock
we came to some hills of sandstone faced with iron, the beginning
of the broken ground in which, they say, J&ocirc;f stands.&nbsp;
We had been gradually ascending all day, and as we reached that,
the highest point of our route, the barometer marked 2660
feet.&nbsp; Here we found a number of little pits, used, so
Hamd&aacute;n explained, for collecting and winnowing
<i>semh</i>, a little red grain which grows wild in this part of
the desert, and is used by the J&ocirc;f people for food.</p>
<p>A little later we sighted two men on a del&uacute;l, the first
people we have seen, except the ghaz&uacute;, since leaving
K&acirc;f.&nbsp; Wilfrid and Mohammed galloped up to see what
they were, and Mohammed, to atone I suppose for his inertness on
a recent occasion, fired several shots, and succeeded in
frightening them <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>out of their wits.&nbsp; They were quite poor people,
dressed only in old shirts, and they had a skin of dates on one
side the camel and a skin of water on the other.&nbsp; They were
out, they said, to look for a man who had been lost in the Wady
Sirh&aacute;n, one of the men sent by Ibn Rashid to K&acirc;f for
the tribute.&nbsp; He had been taken ill, and had stopped behind
his companions, and nobody had seen him since.&nbsp; They had
been sent out by the governor of J&ocirc;f to look for him.&nbsp;
They said that we were only a few hours from the town.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I had remained with our camels, listening to the
remarks of Awwad and Hamd&aacute;n, both dying with curiosity
about the two zellems from J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; At last Awwad could
wait no longer, and begged Hamd&aacute;n to go with him.&nbsp;
They both jumped down from the camels they were riding, and set
off as hard as they could run to meet the J&ocirc;fi, who by this
time had proceeded on their way, while Wilfrid and Mohammed were
returning.&nbsp; Wilfrid on arriving held out to me a handful of
the best dates I have ever eaten, which the men had given
him.&nbsp; The Sher&acirc;ri and Awwad presently came back with
no dates, but a great deal of J&ocirc;f gossip.</p>
<p>We are encamped this evening near some curious tells of red,
yellow, and purple sandstone, a formation exactly similar to
parts of the Sinai peninsula.&nbsp; There is a splendid view to
the south, and we can see far away a blue line of hills <a
name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110"
class="citation">[110]</a> which, <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>they tell us, are beyond J&ocirc;f
at the edge of the Nef&uacute;d!</p>
<p>We have been questioning Hamd&aacute;n about his tribe, the
Sherar&acirc;t, and he gives the following as their principal
sections:&mdash;</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p>El Hueymreh</p>

<p>The Sherar&acirc;t have no horses, but breed the finest
dromedaries in Arabia.&nbsp; Their best breed is called <i>Benat
Udeyhan</i>, (daughters of Udeyhan).&nbsp; With a Bint Udeyhan,
he says, that if you started from where we now are at sunset, you
would be to-morrow at sunrise at K&acirc;f, a distance of a
hundred and eighty miles.&nbsp; A thief not long ago stole a
Sher&acirc;ri del&uacute;l at Mez&aacute;rib, and rode it all the
way to Ha&iuml;l in seven days and nights!</p>
<p><i>January</i> 5.&mdash;A long wearisome ride of twenty-two
miles, always expecting to see J&ocirc;f, and always
disappointed.&nbsp; The ground broken up into fantastic hills and
ridges, but on a lower level than yesterday, descending in fact
all day.&nbsp; Every now and then we caught sight of the Wady
Sirh&aacute;n far away to the right, with blue hills beyond it,
but in front of us there seemed an endless succession of rocky
ridges.&nbsp; At last from the top of one of these there became
visible a black outline, standing darkly out against the yellow
confusion of sandstone hills and barren wadys, which we knew must
be the castle of Marid.&nbsp; <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>It looked a really imposing
fortress, though dreary enough in the middle of this
desolation.&nbsp; Towards this we pushed on, eager for a nearer
view.&nbsp; Then we came to a natural causeway of white rock,
which Awwad and Hamd&aacute;n both affirmed to be a continuation
of the Roman road from Salkhad.&nbsp; We should have liked to
believe this, but it was too clear that the road was one made by
nature.&nbsp; Along this we travelled for some miles till it
disappeared.&nbsp; All of a sudden we came as it were to the edge
of a basin, and there, close under us, lay a large oasis of
palms, surrounded by a wall with towers at intervals, and a
little town clustering round the black castle.&nbsp; We were at
J&ocirc;f.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="gutsumm">The J&ocirc;f oasis&mdash;We are entertained
by Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s lieutenant&mdash;A haunch of wild
cow&mdash;Dancing in the castle&mdash;Prayers&mdash;We go on to
Meskakeh.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">J&ocirc;f</span> is not at all what we
expected.&nbsp; We thought we should find it a large cultivated
district, and it turns out to be merely a small town.&nbsp; There
is nothing at all outside the walls except a few square patches,
half an acre or so each, green with young corn.&nbsp; These are
watered from wells, and irrigated just like the gardens inside
the walls, with little water-courses carefully traced in
patterns, like a jam tart.&nbsp; The whole basin of J&ocirc;f is
indeed barely three miles across at its widest, and looks, what
it no doubt is, the empty basin of a little inland sea.&nbsp;
How, or when, or why, it was originally dried up, is beyond me to
guess (one can only say with Mohammed, it is &ldquo;min
Allah&rdquo;); but the proofs of its pelagic origin are apparent
everywhere.&nbsp; It looks lower than the rest of the Wady
Sirh&aacute;n, with which it probably communicates; and we
thought at first that it might have been the last <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>water-hole,
as it were, of the sea when it dried up.&nbsp; But this is not
really the case, as its lowest part is exactly on a level with
all the hollows of the wady.&nbsp; Its wells are between 1800 and
1900 feet above the sea.&nbsp; They are shallow, only a few feet
from the surface, and the water is drawn by camels pulling a long
rope with a bucket, which empties itself as it reaches the
surface into a kind of trough.&nbsp; The town, with its gardens,
all encircled by a mud wall ten feet high, is about two miles
long from north to south, and half a mile across.&nbsp; The rest
of the plain is nearly a dead flat of sand, with here and there a
patch of hard ground, sandy clay, where the water collects when
it rains, and salt is left when it dries up.</p>
<p>Wherever a well has been sunk, a little garden has been made,
fenced in with a wall, and planted with palms.&nbsp; There are
perhaps a dozen of these outlying farms occupying two or three
acres each.&nbsp; In one place there are four or five houses with
their gardens together, which have the look of a village.&nbsp;
The whole of the basin, except these oases, is dazzlingly white,
showing the palm groves as black patches on its surface.&nbsp;
J&ocirc;f itself contains not more than six hundred houses,
square boxes of mud, clustering, most of them, round the ruin of
Marid, but not all, for there are half a dozen separate clusters
in different parts of the grove.&nbsp; Many of these houses have
a kind of tower, or upper storey, and there are small towers at
irregular intervals all round the <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>outer wall.&nbsp; The chief feature
of the town, besides Marid, is a new castle just outside the
<i>enceinte</i>, inhabited by Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s
lieutenant.&nbsp; It stands on rising ground, and is an imposing
building, square, with battlemented walls forty feet high,
flanked with round and square towers tapering upwards twenty feet
higher than the rest.&nbsp; It has no windows, only holes to
shoot from; and each tower has several excrescences like hoods
(machicoulis) for the same purpose.</p>
<p>There is nothing like a bazaar in J&ocirc;f, nor even streets,
as one generally understands the word, only a number of narrow
tortuous lanes, with mud walls on either side.&nbsp; As we rode
into the town, we found the lanes crowded with armed men, all
carrying swords in the way we had seen at K&acirc;f, dark-visaged
and, we thought, not very pleased to see us.&nbsp; They answered
our &ldquo;salaam aleykum&rdquo; simply, without moving, and let
us pass on without any particular demonstration of
hospitality.&nbsp; To suppose them indifferent, however, was a
mistake; their apparent coldness was only Arab formality, and
when Mohammed began to inquire after the house of his relations,
they very civilly pointed out the way, and one or two of them
came with us.&nbsp; We were led down a number of narrow byways,
and through the palm-gardens to the other side of the town, and
then out by another gate beyond to one of the isolated farms we
had seen from the cliff.&nbsp; It was close by, not a quarter of
a mile, and in a few minutes more we <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>had dismounted, and were being
hospitably entertained in the tidy kahwah of Huseyn&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>What Huseyn&rsquo;s exact relationship is to Mohammed, I have
not yet been able to discover&mdash;Mohammed himself hardly
knows&mdash;but here it is evident that any consanguinity,
however slight, is considered of high importance.&nbsp; We were
no sooner seated by Huseyn&rsquo;s fire, watching the coffee
roasting, than another relation arrived, attracted by the news of
our arrival, and then another, both loud in their expostulations
at our having accepted Huseyn&rsquo;s hospitality, not
theirs.&nbsp; Mohammed was kissed and hugged, and it was all he
could do to pacify these injured relatives by promising to stay a
week with each, as soon as our visit to Huseyn should be
over.&nbsp; Blood here is indeed thicker than water.&nbsp; The
sudden appearance of a twentieth cousin is enough to set
everybody by the ears.</p>
<p>A lamb has been killed, and we have each had the luxury of a
bath in our own tent, and a thorough change of raiment.&nbsp; The
tent is pitched in a little palm garden behind the house, and we
are quite at peace, and able to think over all that has happened,
and make our plans for the future.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 6.&mdash;Last night, while we were sitting
drinking coffee for the ninth or tenth time since our arrival,
two young men came into the kahwah and sat down.&nbsp; They were
very gaily dressed in silk jibbehs, and embroidered shirts under
their drab woollen abbas.&nbsp; They wore red cotton kefiyehs on
<a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>their
heads, bound with white rope, and their swords were
silver-hilted.&nbsp; Everyone in the kahwah stood up as they
entered, and we both thought them to be the sons of the Sheykh,
or some great personage at J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; Wilfrid whispered a
question about them to Huseyn, who laughed and said they were not
sons of sheykhs, but &ldquo;zellemet Ibn Rashid,&rdquo; Ibn
Rashid&rsquo;s men, in fact, his soldiers.&nbsp; The red kefiyeh,
and the silver hilted sword, was a kind of uniform.&nbsp; They
had come, as it presently appeared, from Dowass, the acting
governor of J&ocirc;f, to invite us to the castle, and though we
were sorry to leave Huseyn&rsquo;s quiet garden and his kind
hospitality, we have thought it prudent to comply.&nbsp; Neither
Huseyn nor anyone else seemed to think it possible we could
refuse, for Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s government is absolute at
J&ocirc;f, and his lieutenant&rsquo;s wishes are treated as
commands, not that there seems to be ill-feeling between the
garrison and the town; the soldiers we saw appear to be on good
terms with everybody, and are indeed so good-humoured, that it
would be difficult to quarrel with them.&nbsp; But J&ocirc;f is a
conquered place, held permanently in a state of siege, and the
discipline maintained is very strict.&nbsp; We have moved
accordingly with all our camp to the precincts of the official
residence, and are encamped just under its walls.&nbsp; The kasr,
which, as I have said, is outside the town, was built about
twelve years ago by Metaab ibn Rashid, brother of the Emir
Tell&aacute;l (Mr. Palgrave&rsquo;s friend), and though so modern
a <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>construction, has a perfectly medi&aelig;val look, for
architecture never changes in Arabia.&nbsp; It is a very
picturesque building with its four high towers at the corners,
pierced with loopholes, but without windows.&nbsp; There is one
only door, and that a small one in an angle of the wall, and it
is always kept locked.&nbsp; Inside it the entrance turns and
twists about, and then there is a small court-yard surrounded by
the high walls, and a kahwah, besides a few other small rooms,
all dark and gloomy like dungeons.&nbsp; Here the deputy governor
lives with six soldiers, young men from Ha&iuml;l, who, between
them, govern and garrison and do the police work of
J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; The governor himself is away just now at
Meskakeh, the other small town included in the J&ocirc;f
district, about twenty miles from here.&nbsp; He is a negro
slave, we are told, but a person of great consequence, and a
personal friend of the Emir.</p>
<p>J&ocirc;f, as far as we have been able to learn through
Mohammed, for we don&rsquo;t like to ask too many questions
ourselves, was formally an appanage of the Ibn Shaalans, Sheykhs
of the Roala, and it still pays tribute to Sotamm; but about
twenty years ago Metaab ibn Rashid conquered it, and it has ever
since been treated as part of Nejd.&nbsp; There have been one or
two insurrections, but they have been vigorously put down, and
the J&ocirc;fi are now afraid of stirring a finger against the
Emir.&nbsp; On the occasion of one of these revolts, Metaab cut
down a great <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>many palm trees, and half ruined the town, so they are
obliged to wait and make the best of it.&nbsp; In truth, the
government can hardly be very oppressive.&nbsp; These six
soldiers with the best will in the world cannot do much bullying
in a town of four or five thousand inhabitants.&nbsp; They are
all strong, active, good-humoured young fellows, serving here for
a year at a time, and then being relieved.&nbsp; They are
volunteers, and do not get pay, but have, I suppose, some
advantages when they have done their service.&nbsp; They seem
quite devoted to the Emir.</p>
<p>Four years ago, they tell us, the Turkish Governor of Damascus
sent a military expedition against J&ocirc;f (the same we heard
of at K&acirc;f), and held it for a few months; but Ibn Rashid
complained to the Sultan of this, and threatened to turn them out
and to discontinue the tribute he pays to the Sherif of Medina if
the troops were not withdrawn, so they had to go back.&nbsp; This
tribute is paid by the Emir on account of his outlying
possessions, such as K&acirc;f, Teyma, and J&ocirc;f, which the
Turks have on various occasions attempted to meddle with.&nbsp;
He is, however, quite independent of the Sultan, and acknowledges
no suzerain anywhere.&nbsp; The greatness of Ibn Saoud and the
Wahhabis is now a thing of the past, and Mohammed ibn Rashid is
the most powerful ruler in Arabia.&nbsp; We hear a charming
account of Nejd, at least of the northern part of it.&nbsp; You
may travel anywhere, they say, from J&ocirc;f to Kasim without
escort.&nbsp; The roads are safe everywhere.&nbsp; A robbery <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>has not
been known on the Emir&rsquo;s highway for many years, and people
found loafing about near the roads have their heads cut
off.&nbsp; Ibn Rashid allows no ghaz&uacute;s against travellers,
and when he makes war it is with his enemies.&nbsp; The Ibn
Haddal and Ibn Majil are his friends, but he is on bad terms with
Sotamm and the Sebaa Sheykhs.</p>
<p>There are two twelve pounder cannons of English make in the
castle.&nbsp; They are ancient pieces of no value, but were used,
it appears, in the siege of J&ocirc;f by Metaab.</p>
<p>The J&ocirc;fi are of a different race from the Shammar of
Nejd, being as mixed in their origin almost as the Tudmuri or the
villagers of the Euphrates.&nbsp; Huseyn our first host here,
tells us he belongs to the Ta&iuml;, and that others of his
neighbours are Sirh&aacute;n or Beni Laam.&nbsp; He is not really
a cousin of Mohammed&rsquo;s, but a cousin&rsquo;s cousin; the
real cousins living at Meskakeh.&nbsp; Though we were very
comfortable with him, we are not less well off here; and it is
more interesting being at the kasr.&nbsp; Dowass, the deputy
governor, is a very amiable man, and all his soldiers are
exceedingly civil and obliging. They are a cheerful set of
people, talking openly about everything with us, politics and
all.&nbsp; They assure us Ibn Rashid will be delighted to see us,
but we must see J&ocirc;har, the black governor, first. There are
several real slaves in the fort, but no women.&nbsp; The soldiers
leave their wives behind at Ha&iuml;l when they go away on
service.&nbsp; There are no horses <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>in J&ocirc;f, except one
two-year-old colt belonging to Dubejeh, one of the soldiers, who
all admire our <i>shagra</i> (chestnut mare) amazingly, saying
that there is nothing in Nejd so beautiful.&nbsp; Neither are
there any beasts of burden, not even asses.&nbsp; The few camels
there are in the town are kept for drawing water; and the only
other four-footed creatures I have seen are a few goats and three
half-starved cows at the kasr.&nbsp; There is not an atom of
vegetation within miles of J&ocirc;f, and the camels and these
cows have to eat chopped straw and refuse dates.</p>

<p>Our dinner to-day consisted of a lamb and three other
dishes&mdash;one a sort of paste like the paste used for pasting
paper, another merely rancid butter with chopped onions, and the
third, bread sopped in water&mdash;all nasty except the
lamb.&nbsp; There was, however, afterwards an extra course
brought to us as a surprise, a fillet of &ldquo;wild cow&rdquo;
(probably an antelope) from the Nef&ucirc;d, baked in the ashes,
one of the best meats I ever tasted.</p>
<p>In the evening we had an entertainment of dancing and singing,
in which Dowass, as well as the soldiers, took part.&nbsp; They
performed a kind of sword dance, one performer beating on a drum
made of palm wood and horse hide, while the rest held their
swords over their shoulders and chaunted in solemn measure,
dancing as solemnly.&nbsp; Occasionally the swords were
brandished, and then there was a scream very like what may be
heard in the hunting-field at home.&nbsp; Once or twice there was
a distinct <a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>who-whoop, exactly in the proper key, and with the
proper emphasis.&nbsp; The tunes were many of them striking,
after the manner of Arabian music.&nbsp; One of them ran
thus:&mdash;</p>

</a></p>
<p>The dancing ended, a huge bowl of date molasses (dibs) and
juice from <i>trengs</i> (a gigantic sort of lemon) was mixed;
and surprising quantities of this temperance liquid drunk.&nbsp;
Now we are quiet, outside the castle, which is locked up for the
night, and are at liberty to write or make sketches by moonlight,
things we dare not do in the daytime.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 7.&mdash;Hamd&aacute;n, our Sher&acirc;ri
guide, who had disappeared, returned this morning furtively for
the balance of pay due to him.&nbsp; He says he is afraid of the
people at the castle, and cannot stay with us.</p>
<p>A messenger has come from Meskakeh with an invitation from
J&oacute;har for us, so we are going on there to-morrow.&nbsp; We
are not, however, to stay with J&oacute;har, as he has no house
of his own there, but with our relations, the Ibn Ar&ucirc;ks,
who have at last been really discovered.&nbsp; Nassr ibn
Ar&ucirc;k, the head of the family, hearing of our arrival, has
sent his son with every sort of polite message, and it is to his
house we shall go.&nbsp; The young man is modest, and
well-mannered, without pretension, honest and straightforward, if
one can read <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>anything in faces; and evidently much impressed with
the honour done him by our intended visit.</p>
<p>We have been making calls all the morning, first on our former
host, Huseyn el-Kelb, and the other relatives, and then on one or
two notables of the town.&nbsp; Huseyn says that the Beyt
Hab&ucirc;b, mentioned by Mr. Palgrave, exists, but that the
noblest of all the families is that of Mehsin ibn Dirra, formerly
Sheykh of J&ocirc;f, but now reduced to the condition of one of
the Emir&rsquo;s subjects.&nbsp; Ibn Dirra is not (Mohammed tells
us) by any means pleased at the political changes in J&ocirc;f;
but he is afraid to show more than a half-smothered discontent,
for Mohammed ibn Rashid keeps a hostage for his good conduct in
the person of his eldest son.&nbsp; This youth resides at
Ha&iuml;l, where he is not exactly a prisoner, but cannot return
to his friends.&nbsp; At all the houses we were fed and
entertained, having to drink endless cups of coffee flavoured
with cloves (heyl), and eat innumerable dates, the <i>helwet el
J&ocirc;f</i>, which they say here are the best in Arabia; they
are of excellent flavour, but too sweet and too sticky for
general use.&nbsp; The people of J&ocirc;f live almost entirely
on dates; not, however, on the <i>helwet</i>, which are not by
any means the common sort.&nbsp; There are as many varieties here
of dates as of apples in our orchards, and quite as different
from each other.&nbsp; The kind we prefer for ordinary eating is
light coloured, crisp, and rounder than the helwet; while these
are shapeless, and of the colour of a horse <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>chestnut.&nbsp; It is a great mistake to suppose that
dates are better for being freshly gathered; on the contrary,
they mellow with keeping.&nbsp; The sweeter kinds contain so much
sugar, that when placed in an open dish they half dissolve into a
syrup, in which the sugar forms in large lumps.&nbsp; I have no
doubt that regular sugar could be manufactured from them.</p>
<p>The coffee making is much the same process here as among the
Bedouins of the north, except that it is more tedious.&nbsp;
First, there is an interminable sorting of the beans, which are
smaller and lighter in colour than what one gets in Europe; then,
after roasting, a long pounding in a mortar, though the coffee is
never pounded quite fine; then an extraordinary amount of washing
and rinsing of coffee-pots, five or six of them; and lastly, the
actual boiling, which is done three times.&nbsp; The J&ocirc;f
mortars are very handsome, of red sandstone, the common stone of
the country, and are, I believe, an article of export.&nbsp; I
should like to take one away with me but they are too heavy, a
quarter of a camel load each.&nbsp; The design on them is simple
but handsome, and I should not be surprised if it were very
ancient.&nbsp; The only other manufactures of J&ocirc;f that I
heard of, are cartridge belts and woollen abbas.&nbsp; The former
are showy and tipped with silver, and all the servants have
purchased them; the latter are made of wool brought from
Bagdad.&nbsp; Awwad bought one for six and a half mejidies.</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>We
next had a look at the castle of Marid, the only building of
stone in J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; Its construction dates, I should say,
from medi&aelig;val times, certainly it is not classic, and it
has no particular feature to make it interesting.&nbsp; It looks
best at a distance.&nbsp; I find the map places it a long way
from J&ocirc;f, but in reality it is within the walls of the
town, on the western edge.&nbsp; It stands about 2000 feet above
the sea.</p>
<p>While sitting in Ibn Dirra&rsquo;s house, we saw an instance
of Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s paternal government, and the first sign of
Wahhabism.&nbsp; The midday prayer was called from the roof of
the mosque close by, for there is no minaret in J&ocirc;f, but
for some time nobody seemed inclined to move, taking our visit as
an excuse.&nbsp; Then an old man with a sour face began lecturing
the younger ones, and telling them to get up and go to pray, and
finding precept of no avail, at last gave them the example.&nbsp;
Still the main body of the guests sat on, till suddenly up jumped
the two young soldiers who had come with us, and shouting
&ldquo;kum, kum,&rdquo; get up, get up, set to with the flats of
their swords on the rest and so drove them to the mosque, all but
our host, whose position as such made him sacred from
assault.&nbsp; It is very evident that religion is not
appreciated here, and except the sour looking old man nobody
seemed to take the praying seriously, for the soldiers when they
had done their duty of driving in the others, came back without
ceremony from the mosque.&nbsp; <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>The outward show of religion does
not seem natural among the Arabs.</p>
<p>Another sword dance to-night, and another carouse on
lemonade.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 8.&mdash;A cloudy, almost foggy morning, and a
shower of rain.&nbsp; We wished Dowass and his soldiers good-bye,
and they really seemed sorry to part with us.&nbsp; They are
extraordinarily good-tempered, honest people, and have treated us
with great kindness.&nbsp; Dowass&rsquo;s last attention to me
was the present of an enormous treng as big as a large
cocoanut.&nbsp; The trengs are sour not sweet lemons, but they
have a rind an inch thick, sweet enough to be eaten though very
woolly.</p>
<p>Meskakeh, where we have come to-day, is about twenty miles
from J&ocirc;f, and there is a well-beaten track between the two
places.&nbsp; We were a rather numerous party, as several
J&ocirc;fi came with us for company, and we have Areybi ibn
Ar&ucirc;k, Nassr&rsquo;s son, and another Ar&ucirc;k, a cousin
of his, and a man with a gun who is by way of going on with us to
Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; All the party but ourselves were on foot, for
the J&ocirc;fi never ride, having neither horses nor camels nor
even donkeys.&nbsp; One of the men had with him an ostrich
eggshell slung in a sort of network, and used like a gourd to
hold water.&nbsp; He told me that ostriches are common in the
Nef&ucirc;d, which is now close by.&nbsp; The scenery all the way
was fantastic, sometimes picturesque.&nbsp; First we crossed the
punchbowl of J&ocirc;f to the other side, <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>passing
several ruined farms, the ground absolutely barren, and the
lowest part of it covered with salt.&nbsp; The whole of this
depression is but a mile across.&nbsp; Then our road rose
suddenly a hundred feet up a steep bank of sand, and then again a
hundred and sixty feet over some stony ridges, descending again
to cross a subbkha with a fringe of tamarisks just now in flower,
then tracts of fine ironstone gravel, undistinguishable from
sheep&rsquo;s droppings.&nbsp; About two hours from J&ocirc;f is
a large water-hole, which the J&ocirc;fi call a spring, the water
about eight feet below ground.&nbsp; In the wadys where water had
flowed (for it rained here about a month ago), there were bright
green bulbous plants with crocus flowers, giving a false look of
fertility.&nbsp; In other places there were curious mushroom
rocks of pink sandstone topped with iron, and in the distance
northwards several fine masses of hill, Jebel Hammam&iacute;yeh
or the pigeon mountains being the most remarkable.&nbsp; These
may have been a thousand feet higher than J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; Far
beyond, to the north-east and east, there ran a level line of
horizon at about an equal height, the edge of the Ham&aacute;d,
for all the country we have been crossing is within the area of
the ancient sea, which, we suppose, must have included the Wady
Sirh&aacute;n, J&ocirc;f and Meskakeh.</p>
<p>On one of the rocks I noticed an inscription, or rather
pictures of camels and horses, cut on a flat surface about five
feet across.&nbsp; We could not, however, under the
circumstances, copy it.</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>Meskakeh, though not the seat of J&oacute;har&rsquo;s
government, is a larger town than J&ocirc;f&mdash;seven hundred
houses they say, and palm gardens at least twice as extensive as
the other&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The position of the two towns is much
the same, a broad hollow surrounded by cliffs of sandstone, but
the Meskakeh basin is less regular, and is broken up with
sandhills and outlying tells of rock.&nbsp; Meskakeh, like
J&ocirc;f, has an ancient citadel perched on a cliff about a
hundred feet high, and dominating the town.&nbsp; The town itself
is irregularly built, and has no continuous wall round its
gardens.&nbsp; There are many detached gardens and groups of
houses, and these have not been ruined as those of J&ocirc;f have
been by recent wars.&nbsp; Altogether, it has an exceedingly
flourishing look, not an acre of irrigable land left
unplanted.&nbsp; Everything is neat and clean, the walls fresh
battlemented, and every house trim as if newly built.&nbsp; The
little square plots of barley are surrounded each by its hedge of
wattled palm branches, and the streets and lanes are scrupulously
tidy.&nbsp; Through these we rode without stopping, and on two
miles beyond, to Nassr&rsquo;s farm.&nbsp; We are now in the
bosom of the Ibn Ar&ucirc;k family, after all no myth, but a
hospitable reality, receiving us with open arms, as if they had
been expecting us every day for the last hundred years.&nbsp;
They know the Ibn Ar&ucirc;k ballad and Mohammed&rsquo;s
genealogy far better than he knows it himself, so for the time at
least we may hope to be in clover, and if after all we get no
further, we may feel that we have travelled not quite in
vain.</p>

J&ocirc;f&mdash;Mohammed contracts a matrimonial

thunder-storm.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> stayed three days with Nassr and
his sons, and his sons&rsquo; wives and their children, in their
quiet farm house.&nbsp; It was a rest which we much needed, and
proved besides to be an interesting experience, and an excellent
opportunity of learning more of Arab domestic life than we had
done on our previous journeys.&nbsp; Not that the Ibn Ar&ucirc;ks
of Meskakeh are in themselves of any particular interest.&nbsp;
Like their relations of Tudmur, they have been too long settled
down as mere townspeople, marrying the daughters of the land, and
adopting many of the sordid town notions, but they were honest
and kind-hearted, and the traditions of their origin, still
religiously preserved, cast an occasional gleam of something like
romance on their otherwise matter of fact lives.&nbsp; Nassr, the
best of the elder generation, resembled some small Scottish
laird, poor and penurious, but aware of having better blood in
his veins than his <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>neighbours&mdash;one whose thought, every day in the
year but one, is of how to save sixpence, but who on that one day
shows himself to be a gentleman, and the head of a house.&nbsp;
His sons were quiet, modest, and unpretending, and, like most
young Arabs, more romantically inclined than their father.&nbsp;
They even had a certain appreciation of chivalrous ideas;
especially Turki, the elder, in whom the Bedouin blood and
Bedouin traditions predominated almost to the exclusion of
commercial instincts, while in his brother Areybi, these latter
more than counterbalanced the former.&nbsp; We liked both the
brothers, of course preferring Turki, with whom Wilfrid made
great friends.</p>
<p>Mohammed is less distantly related to these people than I had
supposed.&nbsp; His ancestor, Ali ibn Ar&ucirc;k, was one of the
three brothers who, in consequence of a blood feud, or, as
Wilfrid thinks more likely, to escape the Wahhabi tyranny of a
hundred years ago, left Aared in Nejd, and came north as far as
Tudmur, where Ali married and remained.&nbsp; Another brother,
Abd el-Kader ibn Ar&ucirc;k, had stopped at J&ocirc;f, settled
there, and became Nassr&rsquo;s grandfather.&nbsp; As to the
third, Mutlakh, the descendants of the two former know nothing of
his fate, except that, liking neither Tudmur nor J&ocirc;f he
returned towards Nejd.&nbsp; Some vague report of his death
reached them, but nobody can tell when or how he died.&nbsp;
Nassr came from J&ocirc;f to Meskakeh not many years ago.</p>
<p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>Nassr
is now the head of the family, at least of that branch of it
which inhabits the Meskakeh oasis.&nbsp; But there lives in an
adjoining house to his, his first cousin, Jazi ibn Ar&ucirc;k,
brother to our friend Merzuga, and father to two pretty
daughters.&nbsp; These, with a few other relations, make up a
pleasant little family party, all living in their outlying farm
together.</p>
<p>Of course our first thought on coming amongst them was for a
wife for Mohammed, at whose request I took an early opportunity
of making acquaintance with the women of the family.&nbsp; I
found them all very friendly and amiable, and some of them
intelligent.&nbsp; Most of the younger ones were good
looking.&nbsp; The most important person in the harim was
Nassr&rsquo;s wife, a little old lady named Shemma (candle), thin
and wizened, and wrinkled, with long grey locks, and the weak
eyes of extreme old age; and, though she can have been hardly
more than sixty, she seemed to be completely worn out.&nbsp; She
was the mother of Turki and Areybi; and I had heard from Mohammed
that Nassr had never taken another wife but her.&nbsp; In this,
however, he was mistaken, for on my very first visit, she called
in a younger wife from the adjoining room, and introduced her at
once to me.&nbsp; The second wife came in with two little boys of
two and three years old, the eldest of whom (for they all have
extraordinary names) is called Mattrak, &ldquo;stick;&rdquo; in
spite of which he seemed an amiable, <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>good-tempered child.&nbsp; In this
he resembled his mother, whose respectful manner towards her
elder, Shemma, impressed me favourably; she had, besides, a
really beautiful face.&nbsp; The little boy, Mattrak, I
recognised as a boy I had seen in the morning with old Nassr in
our garden, and supposed to be his grandson.&nbsp; Nassr was
doing his best to spoil the child, after the fashion of old men
among the Arabs.&nbsp; I had then given Mattrak a little red
frock, one I had bought for Sotamm&rsquo;s boy, Mansur, when we
thought we were going to the Roala, and in this the child was now
strutting about, showing off his finery to two very pretty little
girls, his sisters.&nbsp; These two ran in and out during my
visit, helping to bring bowls of dates, and to eat the dates when
brought.&nbsp; Next appeared Turki&rsquo;s two wives, a pretty
one and a plain one, and Areybi&rsquo;s one wife, pretty, and
lately married.&nbsp; All these seemed to be on better terms with
one another than is usually the case among mixed wives and
daughters-in-law.&nbsp; They were extremely anxious to please me,
and I, of course, did my best to satisfy their hospitable wishes
about eating.&nbsp; They offered me dates of countless
kinds,&mdash;dry ones and sticky ones, sweet and less sweet, long
dried ones, and newer ones, a mass of pulp; it was impossible for
one person to do justice to them all.</p>
<p>Shemma treated all the young people with the air of one in
authority, though her tone with them was kind.&nbsp; She,
however, spoke little, while the <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>others talked incessantly and asked
all sorts of questions, requiring more knowledge of Arabic than I
possessed to answer.&nbsp; In the middle of the visit, Nazzch,
Nassr&rsquo;s married daughter, own sister to Turki and Areybi,
arrived with her daughter, and an immense bowl of dates.&nbsp;
She had walked all the way from the town of Meskakeh, about three
miles, carrying this child, a fat heavy creature of four, as well
as the dates, and came in, panting and laughing, to see me.&nbsp;
She was pleasant and lively, very like her brother Turki in face,
that is to say, good-tempered rather than good-looking.&nbsp; Any
one of these young ladies, seen on my first visit, might have
done for Mohammed&rsquo;s project of marriage, but,
unfortunately, they were all either married or too young.&nbsp; I
asked if there were no young ladies already &ldquo;out,&rdquo;
and was told that there were none in Nassr&rsquo;s house, but
that his cousin Jazi had two grown-up daughters, not yet married;
so I held my peace till there should be an opportunity of seeing
them.</p>
<p>Mohammed, in the meantime, had already begun to make inquiries
on his own account, and the first day of our visit was not over
before he came to me with a wonderful account of these very
daughters of Jazi.&nbsp; There were three of them, he declared,
and all more beautiful each than the others, Asr (afternoon),
Ham&uacute; and Muttra&mdash;the first two unfortunately
betrothed already, but Muttra still obtainable.&nbsp; I could see
that already he was <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>terribly in love, for with the
Arabs, a very little goes a long way; and never being allowed to
see young ladies, they fall in love merely through talking about
them.&nbsp; He was very pressing that I should lose no time about
making my visit to their mother, and seemed to think that I had
been wasting my time sadly on the married cousin.&nbsp; Mohammed
has all along declared that he must be guided by my
opinion.&nbsp; I shall know, he pretends, at once, not only
whether Muttra is pretty, but whether good-tempered, likely to
make a good wife.&nbsp; He had been calculating, he said, and
thought forty pounds would be asked as her dower.&nbsp; It is a
great deal to be sure, but then she was really
&ldquo;asil,&rdquo; and the occasion was a unique one&mdash;a
daughter of Jazi!&mdash;a niece of Merzuga!&mdash;a girl of such
excellent family!&mdash;an Ibn Ar&ucirc;k! and Ibn Ar&ucirc;ks
were not to be had every day!&mdash;forty pounds would hardly be
too much.&nbsp; He trusted all to my judgment&mdash;I had so much
discernment, and had seen the wives and daughters of all the
&Aacute;nazeh Sheykhs; I should know what was what, and should
not make a mistake.&nbsp; Still, he would like Abdallah to go
with me, just to spy out things.&nbsp; Abdallah, as a relation,
might be admitted to the door on such an occasion, though he,
Mohammed, of course could not; he might, perhaps, even be allowed
to see the girl, as it were, by accident.&nbsp; With us, the Ibn
Ar&ucirc;ks, the wives and daughters are always veiled, a custom
we brought with us from Nejd, for we are not <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>like the
Bedouins; yet on so important an occasion as this, of arranging a
marriage, a man of a certain age, a dependant, or a poor
relation, is sometimes permitted to see and report.&nbsp; I
promised that I would do all I could to expedite the matter.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the next day Turki was sent for, and a word
dropped to him of the matter in hand, and he was forthwith
dispatched to announce my visit to the mother of the daughters of
Jazi&mdash;Mohammed explaining, that it was etiquette that the
mother should be made acquainted with the object of my visit,
though not necessarily the daughters.&nbsp; Then we went to
Jazi&rsquo;s house, Turki, Abdallah, and I.</p>
<p>Jazi&rsquo;s house is close to Nassr&rsquo;s, only the garden
wall dividing them, and is still smaller than his, a poor place,
I thought, to which to come for a princess; but in Arabia one
must never judge by externals.&nbsp; At the door, among several
women, stood Saad, Jazi&rsquo;s eldest son, who showed us through
the courtyard to an inner room, absolutely dark, except for what
light might come in at the doorway.&nbsp; It is in Arabia that
the expression &ldquo;to darken one&rsquo;s door,&rdquo; must
have been invented, for windows there are none in any of the
smaller houses.&nbsp; There was a smell of goats about the place,
and it looked more like a stable than a parlour for
reception.&nbsp; At first I could see nothing, but I could hear
Saad, who had plunged into the darkness, shaking something <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>in a
corner, and as my eyes got accustomed to the twilight, this
proved to be a young lady, one of the three that I had come to
visit.&nbsp; It was Asr the second, a great, good-looking girl,
very like her cousin Areybi, with his short aquiline nose and
dark eyes.&nbsp; She came out to the light with a great show of
shyness and confusion, hiding her face in her hands, and turning
away even from me; nor would she answer anything to my attempts
at conversation.&nbsp; Then, all of a sudden, she broke away from
us, and rushed across the yard to another little den, where we
found her with her mother and her sister Muttra.&nbsp; I hardly
knew what to make of all this, as besides the shyness, I thought
I could see that Asr really meant to be rude, and the polite
manners of her mother Haliyeh and her little sister Muttra
confirmed me in this idea.&nbsp; I liked Muttra&rsquo;s face at
once; she has a particularly open, honest look, staring straight
at one with her great dark eyes like a fawn, and she has, too, a
very bright fresh colour, and a pleasant cheerful voice.&nbsp; I
paid, then, little attention to Asr&rsquo;s rudeness, and asked
the little girl to walk with me round their garden, which she
did, showing me the few things there were to be seen, and
explaining about the well, and the way they drew the water.&nbsp;
The garden, besides the palm trees, contained figs, apricots, and
vines, and there was a little plot of green barley, on which some
kids were grazing.&nbsp; Muttra told me that in summer they <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>live on
fruit, but that they never preserve the apricots or figs, only
the dates.&nbsp; I noticed several young palm trees, always a
sign of prosperity.&nbsp; The well was about ten feet square at
the top, and carefully faced with stone, the water being only a
few feet below the surface of the ground.&nbsp; Water, she told
me, could be found anywhere at Meskakeh by digging, and always at
the same depth.&nbsp; I was pleased with the intelligence Muttra
showed in this conversation, and pleased with her pretty ways and
honest face, and decided in my own mind without difficulty that
Mohammed would be most fortunate if he obtained her in
marriage.&nbsp; It was promising, too, for their future
happiness, to remark that Haliyeh, the mother, seemed to be a
sensible woman; only I could not understand the strange behaviour
of the elder sister Asr.&nbsp; Abdallah, in the meanwhile,
standing at the door, had made his notes, and come to much the
same conclusion as myself; so we returned with an excellent
report to give to the impatient suitor waiting outside.</p>
<p>Mohammed&rsquo;s eagerness was now very nearly spoiling the
negotiation, for he at once began to talk of his intended
marriage; and the same thing happened to him in consequence,
which happened long ago to Jacob, the son of Isaac.&nbsp; Jazi,
imitating the conduct of Laban, and counting upon his
cousin&rsquo;s anxiety to be married, first of all increased the
dower from forty pounds to sixty, and then <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>endeavoured
to substitute Leah for Rachel, the ill-tempered Asr for the
pretty Muttra.</p>
<p>This was a severe blow to Mohammed&rsquo;s hopes, and a
general council was called of all the family to discuss it and
decide.&nbsp; The council met in our tent, Wilfrid presiding; on
one side sat Mohammed, with Nassr as head of the house; on the
other, Jazi and Saad, representing the bride, while between them,
a little shrivelled man knelt humbly on his knees, who was no
member of the family, but, we afterwards learned, a professional
go-between.&nbsp; Outside, the friends and more distant relations
assembled, Abdallah and Ibrahim Kasir, and half a dozen of the
Ibn Ar&ucirc;ks.&nbsp; These began by sitting at a respectful
distance, but as the discussion warmed, edged closer and closer
in, till every one of them had delivered himself of an
opinion.</p>
<p>Mohammed himself was quite in a flutter, and very pale; and
Wilfrid conducted his case for him.&nbsp; It would be too long a
story to mention all the dispute, which sometimes was so warmly
pressed, that negotiations seemed on the point of being broken
off.&nbsp; Jazi contended that it was impossible he should give
his younger daughter, while the elder ones remained
unmarried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ham&uacute;, it was true, was engaged,
and of her there was no question, but Asr, though engaged too,
was really free; Jeruan, the shock-headed son of Merzuga, to whom
she was betrothed, was not the husband for her.&nbsp; He was an
imbecile, and Asr would never marry him.&nbsp; If a girl <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>declares
that she will not marry her betrothed, she is not engaged, and
has still to seek a husband she likes.&nbsp; But this would not
do.&nbsp; We cited the instance of Jedaan&rsquo;s marriage with
an engaged girl, and the unfortunate sequel, as proving that
Jeruan&rsquo;s consent was necessary for Asr, and Mohammed chimed
in, &ldquo;Ya ibn ammi, ya Jazi, O Jazi!&nbsp; O son of my uncle
how could I do this thing, and sin against my cousin?&nbsp; How
could I take his bride?&nbsp; Surely this would be a shame to us
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fine, we insisted that Muttra it should be
or nobody, and Asr&rsquo;s claim was withdrawn.&nbsp; Still it
was pleaded, Muttra was but a child, hardly fifteen, and unfit
for so great a journey as that to Tudmur.&nbsp; Where indeed was
Tudmur? who of all the J&ocirc;fi had ever been so far?&nbsp;
Mohammed, however, replied that if youth were an obstacle, a year
or two would mend that.&nbsp; He was content to wait for a year,
or two, or even for three years, if need were.&nbsp; He was an
Ibn Ar&ucirc;k, and trained to patience.&nbsp; As to Tudmur, it
was far, but had we not just come thence, and could we not go
back?&nbsp; He would send one of his brothers at the proper time,
with twenty men, thirty, fifty, to escort her.&nbsp; So argued,
the marriage project was at last adopted, as far as Muttra was
concerned.&nbsp; But the question of &ldquo;settlements&rdquo;
was not as easily got over.&nbsp; Here it was very nearly being
wrecked for good and all.&nbsp; Wilfrid had all along intended to
pay the dower for Mohammed, but he would not say so till the
thing was settled, and left Mohammed to fight out <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>the
question of jointure to as good a bargain as they could
make.&nbsp; This Mohammed was very capable of doing, despite the
infirmity of his heart, and strengthened by Abdallah, who took a
strictly commercial view of the whole transaction, a middle sum
was agreed on, and the conference broke up.</p>
<p>Things, however, were not yet to go off quite smoothly.&nbsp;
On the day following, when I went with some little presents for
the bride to Jazi&rsquo;s house, I was met at the door by Jazi
himself, who received me, as I at once perceived, with an
embarrassed air, as also did Haliyeh, for both she and a strange
relation were sitting in the kahwah.&nbsp; To my questions about
Muttra short answers were given; and the conversation was at once
turned on &ldquo;the weather and the crops,&rdquo; or rather on
that Arabian substitute for it, a discussion about locusts.&nbsp;
We had had a heavy thunderstorm in the morning, for which all
were thankful.&nbsp; It would bring grass in the Nef&ucirc;d, but
the locusts there, never were so numerous as this year.&nbsp;
Again I asked about the girls, but again got no reply; and at
last, tired of their idle talk, and quite out of patience, I
exclaimed, &ldquo;O Jazi, what is this?&nbsp; I trust that
you&mdash;and you, O Haliyeh,&mdash;are pleased at this
connection with Mohammed.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which he replied, in a
sing-song voice, &ldquo;Inshallah, inshallah,&rdquo; and Haliyeh
repeated &ldquo;Inshallah,&rdquo; and the stranger.&nbsp; I saw
that something must be wrong, for it was no answer to my <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>question,
and rose to go.&nbsp; Then Haliyeh went out with me into the
yard, and explained what had happened.&nbsp; Asr, it appeared,
with her violent temper, was frightening them all out of their
wits.&nbsp; She would not hear of her sister being married before
herself, or making so much better a match.&nbsp; Jeruan she
despised, though he was Sheykh of K&acirc;f; and she wanted to
marry the Sheykh of Tudmur herself.&nbsp; She had tormented old
Jazi into withdrawing his consent; and Muttra was afraid of
her.&nbsp; What was to be done?&nbsp; I said it was no use
arguing about this over again; that if she and her husband were
really not able to manage their daughters, we must look out
elsewhere for Mohammed; that I hoped and trusted Asr would not be
so foolish as to stand in the way of her sister&rsquo;s
happiness, for it would not profit her.&nbsp; This bad temper of
hers made it more than ever certain that she could not marry
Mohammed, and, in fine, that the family must make up their minds,
yes or no, about Muttra, and at once, for we were leaving
Meskakeh presently, and must have the matter settled.&nbsp; I
then saw the two girls, and spoke to them in the same strain, and
with such effect that a few hours later, Mohammed, who had fallen
into low spirits about the affair, now came with a joyful
countenance to say that the marriage contract would be signed
that evening.</p>
<p>Signed, therefore, it was, though to the last moment
difficulty on difficulty was raised, and a <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>lamentably
haggling spirit displayed by all except Turki in the matter of
the dower.&nbsp; Fifty Turkish pounds was, however, the sum
ultimately fixed on; and Wilfrid refused curtly to advance a
beshlik beyond it, even to buy off a cousin who unaccountably
appeared on the scene and claimed his right to Muttra or an
equivalent for her in coin.&nbsp; It was not very dignified this
chaffering about price; and people do better in England, leaving
such things to be settled by their lawyers.</p>
<p>Everything, however, was at last arranged, the marriage
contract written out and signed, and everybody made happy.&nbsp;
Then the rest of the evening was spent in jubilation.&nbsp; A kid
was killed and eaten, songs sung, and stories told, nor was, as
might be expected, the Ar&ucirc;k ballad left out of the
programme.&nbsp; Nassr is a poet, and recited an ode impromptu
for the occasion.&nbsp; Among the guests were two pilgrims from
Mecca&mdash;so at least they called themselves&mdash;and some men
who had run away from the Turkish conscription in Syria.&nbsp;
These feasted with the rest, as though they too had been
relations.&nbsp; And so ended Mohammed&rsquo;s marriage
negotiations.&nbsp; He is to come back next year or send for
Muttra; but for the present he is to be content and wait.</p>
<p>While this family arrangement was in progress, we had also on
hand a more important negotiation of our own, and that was to get
the governor&rsquo;s permission for our journey on to
Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; The first <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>thing to be done was to make friends
with J&oacute;har, for all in this despotic country depends upon
his good will and pleasure; and if he had chosen to send us back
to K&acirc;f by the Wady Sirh&aacute;n, I do not know that we
could have offered any resistance.&nbsp; J&ocirc;f is not an easy
place to get away from.&nbsp; It is more than three hundred miles
from the nearest point on the Euphrates, and without the
governor&rsquo;s leave no one would have dared to travel a mile
with us.&nbsp; Accordingly, the day after our arrival at
Meskakeh, we called on J&oacute;har, who had been warned of our
visit, and received us in state.</p>
<p>J&oacute;har is a perfectly black negro, with repulsive
African features; tall, and very fat, and very vain.&nbsp; He had
put on his finest clothes to receive us, a number of gaudy silk
jibbehs one over the other, a pair of sky-blue
trousers&mdash;things new to us in Arabia&mdash;a black and gold
abba, and a purple kefiyeh.&nbsp; His shirt was stiff with
starch, and crackled every time he moved.&nbsp; He carried a
handsome gold-hilted sword, and looked altogether as barbaric a
despot as one need wish to see.&nbsp; He kept us waiting nearly
ten minutes in the kahwah, to add, I suppose, to his importance,
and then came in behind a procession of armed men, all of them
well got up with silver hilted swords, silver ornamented belts,
and blue and red kefiyehs bound with thick white aghals.&nbsp; He
affected the affable, rather languid air of a royal personage,
passing from one subject of <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>conversation to another without
transition, and occasionally asking explanations of our remarks
or questions from one or other of his attendants.&nbsp; It struck
me as eminently absurd to see this negro, who is still a slave,
the centre of an adulous group of white courtiers, for all these
Arabs, noble as many of them are in blood, were bowing down
before him, ready to obey his slightest wink and laugh at his
poorest joke.&nbsp; After the first few moments of dignified
silence, J&oacute;har, as I have said, became affable, and began
asking the news.&nbsp; We had come from the north, and could tell
him all about the war.&nbsp; What was Sotamm doing and what was
Ibn Smeyr,&mdash;the latter evidently a hero with the J&ocirc;fi
or rather with the Ha&iuml;l people, for they are not friends
with Sotamm, and old Mohammed Dukhi is considered Sotamm&rsquo;s
great rival.&nbsp; We were glad to be able to say that we had
seen Ibn Smeyr himself at Damascus not a month ago.&nbsp;
J&oacute;har told us in return of a report recently brought in to
Meskakeh by some Sleb that the Roala had been beaten in a fight
with Mohammed Dukhi, and that Sotamm was killed&mdash;a report we
were sorry to hear.</p>
<p>Then, but in a tone of minor interest, we were questioned
about the Sultan.&nbsp; He had made peace with the Muscov,
J&oacute;har was glad to hear it.&nbsp; Peace was a good thing,
and now &ldquo;inshallah es Sultan mabsutin,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
Sultan, let us hope, was pleased;&rdquo; this with a mock
sentimental, patronising accent and <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>a nasal twang in the voice, which
was extremely comic.&nbsp; A little whispering then took place
between Mohammed and one of the suite, which resulted in their
going out together, to hand over to J&oacute;har the presents we
had brought for him.&nbsp; Mohammed was, I believe,
cross-questioned as to our position and the objects of our
journey, and answered, as it had been agreed beforehand he should
do, that we were going to Bussora to meet friends, and that we
had come by way of J&ocirc;f to avoid the sea-voyage.&nbsp; This,
though of course not by any means the whole truth, was true as
far as it went, and was a story easily understood and accepted by
those to whom it was told.&nbsp; Mohammed added, moreover, that
as we had happened to pass through the Emir&rsquo;s dominions,
the English Beg was anxious to pay his respects to Ibn Rashid at
Ha&iuml;l before going any further, and begged J&oacute;har to
give us the necessary guides.&nbsp; This, after some discussion,
and some coyness on the governor&rsquo;s part, he consented to
do.&nbsp; His heart had been softened by the handsome clothes we
had given him, and I believe a small present in money was also
talked of between him and Mohammed.</p>
<p>When we were summoned again to J&oacute;har&rsquo;s presence,
this time on the house-top, we found the negro&rsquo;s face
wreathed in smiles, and our journey being discussed as a settled
matter.&nbsp; Carpets were then spread, and we all sat down on
the roof and had breakfast, boiled meat on rice, with a sharp
sauce to pour over the rice, and then after the usual <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>washings
and el hamdu lillahs we retired, extremely pleased to get away
from the flies and the hot sun of J&oacute;har&rsquo;s roof; and
not a little thankful for the good turn things had taken with
us.&nbsp; As Wilfrid remarked, when we were well on our mares
again and riding home, J&oacute;har was just the picture of a
capricious despot, and one who, if he had been in a bad humour,
might have ordered our heads off, with no more ceremony than he
had ordered breakfast.&nbsp; Our last day at Meskakeh was a quiet
one.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 11.&mdash;Every morning since we have been here
there has been a fog, and to-day (Saturday), as I have already
said, it has rained heavily.&nbsp; The rain came with thunder and
lightning, as I believe is almost always the case in this part of
the world.&nbsp; I am much surprised to learn, in talking of the
lightning, that nobody at Meskakeh has heard of people being
killed by it, and Mohammed confirms the statement made here, by
saying that the same is the case at Tudmur.&nbsp; He seemed
astonished when I asked him, at lightning being thought
dangerous, and says that accidents from it never occur in the
desert.&nbsp; This is strange.&nbsp; The surface soil of Meskakeh
is very nearly pure sand, and the rain runs through it as quickly
as it falls, remaining only in a few hollows, where there is a
kind of sediment hard enough to hold it.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the weather cleared, and we made a little
expedition to the top of the low tell just outside Nassr&rsquo;s
farm.&nbsp; The tell is of sandstone rock, <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>orange
coloured below, but weathered black on the upper surface.&nbsp;
It is not more than a hundred feet high, but standing alone, it
commands a very extensive view, curious as all views in the
J&ocirc;f district are, and very pretty besides.&nbsp; In the
fore-ground just below lay the farm, a square walled enclosure of
three or four acres, with its palms and ithel trees, and its two
low mud houses, and its wells, looking snug and trim and well to
do.&nbsp; Beyond, looking westwards, three other farms were
visible, spots of dark green in the broken wilderness of sand and
sandstone rock, and then behind them Meskakeh, only its palm-tops
in sight, and the dark mass of its citadel rising over them in
fantastic outline.&nbsp; The long line of the palm grove
stretched far away to the south, disappearing at last in a
confused mass of sand-hills.&nbsp; These specially attracted our
notice, for they marked the commencement of the Nef&ucirc;d, not
indeed the great Nef&ucirc;d, but an outlying group of dunes
tufted with ghada, and not at all unlike those passed through by
the Calais and Boulogne railway.&nbsp; Our route, we know, lies
across them, and we are to start to-morrow.</p>
<p>While I sat sketching this curious view, Wilfrid, who had
climbed to the top of a tall stone, crowning the hill, came back
with the news that he had discovered an inscription.&nbsp; We
have been looking out, ever since our arrival in the sandstone
district, for traces of ancient writing, but have hitherto found
nothing except some doubtful scratches, and a few <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>of those
simple designs one finds everywhere on the sandstone,
representing camels and gazelles.&nbsp; Here however, were three
distinctly formed letters, 
<a href="images/p148.jpg">
<img alt=
"Incised characters"
title=
"Incised characters"
src="images/p148.jpg" />
</a> two of them belonging to the Greek alphabet.</p>
<p>It was evident, too, by the colour of the incisions, that they
had been there for very many years.&nbsp; On these we have built
a number of historical conjectures relating to Meskakeh, and its
condition in classical times.</p>
<p>When we came home again, we found that Mohammed had been to
make the last arrangements with J&oacute;har for our
journey.&nbsp; The great man had raised objections at one point
of the negotiations, but these had been settled by a <i>dahab</i>
or gold piece, and he has now agreed to send a man with us, a
professional guide for crossing the Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; It seems
that there are two lines by which Ha&iuml;l may be reached, one
of thirteen and the other of ten days&rsquo; journey.&nbsp; The
first is better suited, they say, for heavy laden camels, as the
sand is less deep, but we shall probably choose the shorter
route, if only for the sake of seeing the Nef&ucirc;d at its
worst.&nbsp; For the Nef&ucirc;d has been the object of our
dreams all through this journey, as the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of
desert in the world.&nbsp; We hear wonderful accounts of it here,
and of the people who have been lost in it.&nbsp; This ten
days&rsquo; journey represents something like two hundred miles,
and there are only two wells on the way, one on the second, and
another on the eighth day.&nbsp; The <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>guide will bring his own camel, and
carry a couple of waterskins, and we have bought four more,
making up the whole number to eight.&nbsp; This will have to
suffice for our mares as well as for ourselves, and we shall have
to be very careful.&nbsp; We have laid in a sufficient stock of
dates and bread, and have still got one of the kids left to start
with in the way of meat, the other has just been devoured as I
have said, and cannot be replaced.&nbsp; Provisions of every kind
are difficult to procure at Meskakeh; it was only by the exercise
of a little almost Turkish bullying that J&oacute;har has been
able to get us a camel load of corn.</p>
<p>The rain is over and the moon shining.&nbsp; All our
preparations are made for crossing the Nef&ucirc;d, and in a few
hours we shall be on our way.&nbsp; We shall want all our
strength for the next ten days.</p>

150</span>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We were now traversing an immense ocean of
loose reddish sand, unlimited to the eye, and heaped up in
enormous ridges running parallel to each other from north to
south, undulation after undulation, each swell two or three
hundred feet in average height, with slant sides and rounded
crests furrowed in every direction by the capricious gales of the
desert.&nbsp; In the depths between the traveller finds himself
as it were imprisoned in a suffocating sand pit, hemmed in by
burning walls on every side; while at other times, while
labouring up the slope, he overlooks what seems a vast sea of
fire, swelling under a heavy monsoon wind, and ruffled by a cross
blast into little red hot waves.&rdquo;&mdash;<span

<p class="gutsumm">Mohammed in love&mdash;We enter the red sand

<p><i>January</i> 12.&mdash;We left the farm this morning in a
thick fog, among the benedictions of the Ibn Ar&ucirc;ks.&nbsp;
They have treated us kindly, and we were sorry to say good-bye to
them, especially to Turki and Areybi, although we are a little
disappointed in our expectations of the family in general.&nbsp;
In spite of their noble birth and their Nejdean traditions, they
have the failings of town Arabs in regard to money, and it was a
shock to our feelings that Nassr, our host, expected a small
present in money at parting, nominally for the women, but in
reality, no doubt, for himself.&nbsp; No desert sheykh, however
poor, would have pocketed the mejidies.&nbsp; The boys too asked
for gifts, the elder wanted a cloak, because <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>one had
been given to his brother, the younger, a j&iacute;bbeh, because
he already had a cloak; and other members of the household came
with little skins full of dates or semneh in their hands, in the
guise of farewell offerings, and lingered behind for something in
return.&nbsp; All this of course was perfectly fair, and we were
pleased to make them happy with our money; but it hardly tallied
with the fine sentiments they had been in the habit of
expressing, in season and out of season, about the duties of
hospitality.&nbsp; Such small disappointments, however, must be
borne, and borne cheerfully, for people are not perfect anywhere,
and a traveller has no right to expect more abroad than he would
find at home.&nbsp; In England we might perhaps not have been
received at all, while here our welcome had been perfectly honest
at starting, whatever the afterthought may have been.&nbsp; So
Wilfrid solemnly kissed the relations all round, and exchanged
promises of mutual good-will and hopes of meeting; I went in to
the harim to say good-bye to the rest of the family, and
fortunately was not expected to kiss them all round; and then we
set out on our way.</p>
<p>Our course lay due south over the sand hills we saw yesterday,
and presently these shut out Meskakeh and its palm groves from
our view, and we were once more reduced to our own travelling
party of eight souls, with Radi our new guide, and fairly on the
road to Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; These sand dunes are not really <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>the
Nef&ucirc;d, and are much like what may be seen elsewhere in the
desert, in the Sahara for instance, or in certain parts of the
peninsula of Sinai.&nbsp; They are very picturesque, being of
pure white sand, from fifty to a hundred feet high, with
intervening spaces of harder ground, and are covered with
vegetation.&nbsp; The ghada here grows quite into a tree, with
fine gnarled trunks, nearly white, and feathery grey
foliage.&nbsp; We met several shepherds with their flocks, sent
here to graze from the town, and parties of women gathering
firewood.&nbsp; Mohammed amused us very much all the morning,
talking with these wood gatherers.&nbsp; He had managed to get a
glimpse of his bride elect and her sister before starting, and
fancies himself desperately in love, though he cannot make up his
mind which of the two he prefers.&nbsp; Sometimes it is Muttra,
as it ought to be, and sometimes the other, for no better reason,
as far as we can learn, than that she is taller and older, for he
did not see their faces.&nbsp; His conversations to-day with the
wood gatherers shewed a <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of mind
neither of us suspected.&nbsp; He would ride on whenever he saw a
party of these women, and when we came up was generally to be
found in earnest discussion with the oldest and ugliest of them
on the subject of his heart.&nbsp; He would begin by asking them
whether they were from Meskakeh, and lead round the conversation
to the Ibn Ar&ucirc;k family, and if he found that the women knew
them, he would vaguely ask how <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>many daughters there were in
Jazi&rsquo;s house, and whether married or unmarried.&nbsp; Then
he would hint that he had heard that the eldest one was very
beautiful, and ask cautiously after the youngest, ending always
by the disclosure that he himself was an Ibn Ar&ucirc;k from
Tudmur, and that he was engaged to whichever of the two unmarried
ones the old women had seemed to favour in their
descriptions.&nbsp; By this process he had quite lost his head
about both sisters, sometimes fancying that he was the happiest
of men, and sometimes that Jazi had passed off the less valuable
of his daughters upon him.&nbsp; On such occasions he would turn
to me and beg me to repeat for the hundredth time my description
of Muttra&rsquo;s merits, which consoled him until he met
somebody else to raise new doubts in his mind.</p>
<p>After about eight miles of travelling through the sand dunes,
we came out rather suddenly on the village of Kara, the last that
we shall see for many a day.&nbsp; It is commanded by a rocky
mound, with a ruin on it, and contains seventy or eighty houses;
the palm grove surrounding it is remarkable for the palms and
ithel trees.&nbsp; The fog had cleared off, and the sun was hot
enough to make us glad to sit down for a few minutes under the
mud wall which encloses the oasis.&nbsp; Some villagers came out,
and we had a little chat about Kara and its sheykh, while our
mares were being watered from a well close by.&nbsp; They told us
we <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>should find a Roala camp not far upon our way, for the
camels from it were watered from this very well.&nbsp; Formerly
Kara, like J&ocirc;f and Meskakeh, was a fief of the Ibn
Shaalans, and they still pay a small tribute to Sotamm, but in
return they make the Bedouins pay for the water they use.&nbsp;
There is no danger of being attacked by the Roala or anyone else,
for we are in Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s country now, where highway
robbery is not allowed.&nbsp; The villagers were very hospitable
in their offers of entertainment if we would remain at Kara, but
there was nothing in the place sufficiently interesting to detain
us, so we went on.&nbsp; It contains, like J&ocirc;f and
Meskakeh, a ruined castle on a low tell, but the ruins are now
not much more than the foundations of old stone walls made
without cement.</p>
<p>Not long after leaving the village, we came upon a party of
Roala, with several hundred camels coming in to Kara for
water.&nbsp; They were unarmed, and travelling as peaceably as
peasants would in Italy.&nbsp; They told us their camp was out of
our way, and too far off for us to reach to-night, but that we
should find Beneyeh ibn Shaalan, a cousin of Sotamm&rsquo;s, near
the well of Shakik our watering place for to-morrow.&nbsp; It
argued well for the security of the country, to find parties of
villagers, as we presently did, out in the sand dunes many miles
beyond Kara, with all these Bedouins about.&nbsp; But really
there seem to be law and order in Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s
government.&nbsp; After travelling on for <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>another two
hours and a half in broken ground, we came at last to a steep
acclivity which proved, when we had mounted it, to be the further
edge of the Meskakeh depression, and above it we found ourselves
on a gravelly plain.&nbsp; The view from this edge, looking back,
was very interesting, and gave us at once an idea of the
geography of the whole country, the great basin of Meskakeh with
its tells and sand hills, the long ridge of hill under which the
oasis stands, the range of Jebel Hammamiyeh too, all mere islands
in the basin, which seems moreover to include J&ocirc;f as well
as the eastern villages in its main circuit.&nbsp; Wilfrid has
little doubt now that Meskakeh and J&ocirc;f are really only the
tail as it were of the Wady Sirh&aacute;n or rather its head, for
the whole must be in shape something like a tadpole, and this
point its nose.</p>
<p>The Ham&aacute;d or plain where we now were, is three hundred
and fifty feet higher than Kara and Meskakeh, or 2220 feet above
the sea.&nbsp; It is absolutely level and bare of vegetation, a
flat black expanse of gravelly soil covered with small round
pebbles, extending southwards to the horizon, and quite unlike
anything in the basin below.&nbsp; We were much surprised to find
such an open plain in front of us, for we had expected nothing
now but sand, but the sand, though we could not see it, was not
far off, and this was only as it were the shore of the great
Nef&ucirc;d.</p>
<p>At half past three o&rsquo;clock we saw a red streak on <a

before us, which rose and gathered as we approached it,
stretching out east and west in an unbroken line.&nbsp; It might
at first have been taken for an effect of mirage, but on coming
nearer we found it broken into billows, and but for its red
colour not unlike a stormy sea seen from the shore, for it rose
up, as the sea seems to rise, when the waves are high, above the
level of the land.&nbsp; Somebody called out &ldquo;the
Nef&ucirc;d,&rdquo; and though for a while we were incredulous,
we were soon convinced.&nbsp; What surprised us was its colour,
that of rhubarb and magnesia, nothing at all like the sand we had
hitherto seen, and nothing at all like what we had
expected.&nbsp; Yet the Nef&ucirc;d it was, the great red desert
of central Arabia.&nbsp; In a few minutes we had cantered up to
it, and our mares were standing with their feet in its first
waves.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 13.&mdash;We have been all day in the
Nef&ucirc;d, which is interesting beyond our hopes, and charming
into the bargain.&nbsp; It is, moreover, quite unlike the
description I remember to have read of it by Mr. Palgrave, which
affects one as a nightmare of impossible horror.&nbsp; It is true
he passed it in summer, and we are now in mid-winter, but the
physical features cannot be much changed by the change of
seasons, and I cannot understand how he overlooked its main
characteristics.&nbsp; The thing that strikes one first about the
Nef&ucirc;d is its colour.&nbsp; It is not white like the sand
dunes we passed yesterday, nor yellow as the sand is in parts of
the <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>Egyptian desert, but a really bright red, almost
crimson in the morning when it is wet with the dew.&nbsp; The
sand is rather coarse, but absolutely pure, without admixture of
any foreign substance, pebble, grit, or earth, and exactly the
same in tint and texture everywhere.&nbsp; It is, however, a
great mistake to suppose it barren.&nbsp; The Nef&ucirc;d, on the
contrary, is better wooded and richer in pasture than any part of
the desert we have passed since leaving Damascus.&nbsp; It is
tufted all over with ghada bushes, and bushes of another kind
called <i>yerta</i>, which at this time of the year when there
are no leaves, is exactly like a thickly matted vine.&nbsp; Its
long knotted stems and fibrous trunk give it so much that
appearance, that there is a story about its having originally
been a vine.&nbsp; The ras&uacute;l Allah (God&rsquo;s prophet),
Radi says, came one day to a place where there was a vineyard,
and found some peasants pruning.&nbsp; He asked them what they
were doing, and what the trees were, and they, fearing his
displeasure or to make fun of him, answered, these are
&ldquo;yerta&rdquo; trees, yerta being the first name that came
into their heads.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yerta inshallah, yerta let them be
then,&rdquo; rejoined the prophet, and from that day forth they
ceased to be vines and bore no fruit.&nbsp; There are, besides,
several kinds of camel pasture, especially one new to us called
adr, on which they say sheep can feed for a month without wanting
water, and more than one kind of grass.&nbsp; Both camels and
mares are therefore pleased with the <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>place, and we are delighted with the
abundance of firewood for our camps.&nbsp; Wilfrid says that the
Nef&ucirc;d has solved for him at last the mystery of
horse-breeding in Central Arabia.&nbsp; In the hard desert there
is nothing a horse can eat, but here there is plenty.&nbsp; The
Nef&ucirc;d accounts for everything.&nbsp; Instead of being the
terrible place it has been described by the few travellers who
have seen it, it is in reality the home of the Bedouins during a
great part of the year.&nbsp; Its only want is water, for it
contains but few wells; all along the edge, it is thickly
inhabited, and Radi tells us that in the spring, when the grass
is green after rain, the Bedouins care nothing for water, as
their camels are in milk, and they go for weeks without it,
wandering far into the interior of the sand desert.</p>
<p>We have been travelling through the Nef&ucirc;d slowly all
day, and have occupied ourselves in studying its natural
features.&nbsp; At first sight it seemed to us an absolute chaos,
and heaped up here and hollowed out there, ridges and cross
ridges, and knots of hillocks all in utter confusion, but after
some hours&rsquo; marching we began to detect a uniformity in the
disorder, which we are occupied in trying to account for.&nbsp;
The most striking features of the Nef&ucirc;d are the great
horse-hoof hollows which are scattered all over it (Radi calls
them <i>fulj</i>).&nbsp; These, though varying in size from an
acre to a couple of hundred acres, are all precisely alike in
shape and direction.&nbsp; They resemble very exactly the track
of <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>an
unshod horse, that is to say, the toe is sharply cut and
perpendicular, while the rim of the hoof tapers gradually to
nothing at the heel, the frog even being roughly but fairly
represented by broken ground in the centre, made up of converging
water-courses.&nbsp; The diameter of some of these fuljes must be
at least a quarter of a mile, and the depth of the deepest of
them, which we measured to-day, proved to be 230 feet, bringing
it down very nearly exactly to the level of the gravelly plain
which we crossed yesterday, and which, there can be little doubt,
is continued underneath the sand.&nbsp; This is all the more
probable, as we found at the bottom of this deepest fulj, and
nowhere else, a bit of hard ground.&nbsp; The next deepest fulj
we measured was only a hundred and forty feet, and was still
sandy at the lowest point, that is to say, just below the point
of the frog.&nbsp; Though the soil composing the sides and every
part of the fuljes is of pure sand, and the immediate surface
must be constantly shifting, it is quite evident that the general
outline of each has remained unchanged for years, possibly for
centuries.&nbsp; The vegetation proves this; for it is not a
growth of yesterday, and it clothes the fuljes like all the
rest.&nbsp; Moreover, our guide, who has travelled backwards and
forwards over the Nef&ucirc;d for forty years, asserts that it
never changes.&nbsp; No sandstorm ever fills up the hollows, or
carries away the ridges.&nbsp; He knows them all, and has known
them ever since he was a boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;They were made so by
<a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wilfrid has been casting about,
however, for some natural theory to account for their formation,
but has not yet been able to decide whether they are owing to the
action of wind or water, or to inequalities of the solid ground
below.&nbsp; But at present he inclines to the theory of
water.&nbsp; We shall be able perhaps to say more of them
hereafter, when we have seen more of them, and I therefore
reserve my remarks.&nbsp; We have had a long day&rsquo;s journey,
plodding up to the camel&rsquo;s fetlocks in sand, and now it is
time to look after Hanna, who is busy cooking.&nbsp; Height of
our camp 2440 feet; but the highest level crossed during the day
was 2560 feet.&nbsp; Nobody seen all day but one Roala on a
del&uacute;l, who told us there was a camp to our left.&nbsp; We
looked for it, but only made out camels at a great distance.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 14.&mdash;Another bright clear morning, but
with a cold wind from the south-east.&nbsp; Nothing can be more
bright and sparkling than the winter&rsquo;s sun reflected from
these red sands.&nbsp; The fuljes have again been the object of
our attention.&nbsp; We find that they all point in the same
direction, or nearly so, that is to say, with the toe of the
horse-hoof towards the west, though the steepest part of the
declivity varies a little, sometimes the southerly and sometimes
the northerly aspect being more abrupt than that facing
east.&nbsp; This would seem to point rather to wind than water as
being the original cause of the depressions.</p>

</a></p>
<p>At the edge, moreover, of <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>the large fuljes there is generally
a tallish mound of sand with a ridge, such as one sees on the top
of a snow peak, and evidently caused by the wind, the lee side
being steep and the weather side rounded.&nbsp; These seem to
change with a change of wind and are generally bare of
vegetation, and what is singular, of a lighter coloured sand than
the rest.&nbsp; One can guess the existence of a deep fulj from a
long way off, by the presence of one of these snowy looking
mounds on the horizon.&nbsp; It is seldom that one can see very
far in the Nef&ucirc;d, as one is always toiling up or down
sandslopes, or creeping like a fly round the edges of these great
basins.&nbsp; The ground is generally pretty even, just round the
edges, and one goes from one fulj to another so as to take this
advantage of level.&nbsp; We rode up to the top of one or two of
the highest sand peaks, and from one of them made out a line of
hills about fifteen miles off to the west-south-west, with an
isolated headland beyond, which we recognized as the Ras el Tawil
pointed out to us the day we arrived at J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; From
these heights too we could observe the lay of the fuljes, and
make out that they followed each other in strings, not always in
a straight line, but as a wady would go, winding gently
about.&nbsp; This made us speculate on the water theory
again.&nbsp; Wilfrid thinks that there may be a very gradual
slope in the plain beneath the sand, and that whenever rain
falls, as of course it must do here sometimes, it sinks through
to the hard ground and flows under the <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>sand along
shallow winding wadys, and that the sand in this way is
constantly slipping very gradually down the incline, and wherever
there is a slope in the plain below, there the fulj occurs above
it. <a name="citation162"></a><a href="#footnote162"
class="citation">[162]</a></p>
<p>This notion is favoured by what we have observed of the bare
places, where such occur, for they always slope down towards the
west.&nbsp; Radi assures us that no water ever collects in the
fuljes even after rain.&nbsp; It runs into them and
disappears.&nbsp; While we were discussing these points of
natural history, we suddenly perceived camels grazing at the edge
of a fulj not half a mile below us, and jumped on to our mares in
a great hurry.&nbsp; I have contrived a bandage which enables me
to mount quickly, and ever since the ghaz&uacute; in the Wady
Sirh&aacute;n, we keep a good look-out for enemies.&nbsp; We then
rode down to see what was to be seen, and presently found half a
dozen people, men and women, in a fulj, and several more camels
grazing near a tent.&nbsp; The tent was a mere awning with a back
to it, and as soon as they saw us the women ran and pulled it
down, while the men rushed off to the nearest camels, and made
them kneel.&nbsp; They were evidently in a fright, and so quickly
was it all done that by the time we had ridden up, the tent and
tent furniture, such as there was, were loaded and ready to
go.&nbsp; The Arabs take pride in being able to strike camp and
march at almost a moment&rsquo;s notice, and in this case I think
it hardly took three <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>minutes.&nbsp; They seemed much
surprised and puzzled at our appearance when we rode up, and at
first said they were Roala, but when our people joined us they
confessed that they were of the Howeysin, a very poor tribe
despised by the rest of the Bedouins and holding much the same
position as the Sleb.&nbsp; They were, however, to our eyes
undistinguishable from other Bedouins.</p>
<p>I asked Mohammed after this, how it was that in the desert
each tribe seemed so readily recognized by their fellows, and he
told me that each has certain peculiarities of dress or features
well known to all.&nbsp; Thus the Shammar are in general tall,
and the Sebaa very short but with long spears.&nbsp; The Roala
spears are shorter, and their horses smaller.&nbsp; The Shammar
of Nejd wear brown abbas, the Harb are black in face, almost like
slaves, and Mohammed told me many more details as to other tribes
which I do not remember.&nbsp; He said that Radi had recognised
these people as Howeysin directly, by their wretched tent.&nbsp;
He then reminded us of how we had been deceived last year by the
ghaz&uacute; we had met in the Ham&aacute;d the day we found
Jedaan.&nbsp; It was very lucky, he declared, that nothing
disagreeable had happened then, for he had found out since that
the nine people Wilfrid had ridden up to talk to, were in reality
a ghaz&uacute; of Amarrat, headed by Reja himself, Sheykh of the
Erfuddi section of that tribe.&nbsp; Reja had come in not many
weeks later to Palmyra to buy corn, and had stayed two days in <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>Abdallah&rsquo;s house, and had recognized him as the
man who was with the Beg that day.&nbsp; These Amarrat had been
in the act of discussing how they should attack our caravan when
Wilfrid rode up, and the fact of his doing so alone made them
imagine that our caravan was a very strong one, so they had
decided on leaving us alone.&nbsp; Mohammed and Reja were now
friends, Reja having given Mohammed a falcon on going away, and
Mohammed the strange present of a winding-sheet.&nbsp;
Winding-sheets he explains are much esteemed by the Bedouins, and
this one had been made by Mohammed&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>Soon after this we came upon a real Roala camp, at least a
camp of their slaves.&nbsp; The men were not negroes, though very
dark and ill-looking.&nbsp; They explained that they belonged to
Beneyeh ibn Shaalan, a cousin of Sotamm&rsquo;s, and the head of
the tribe now in the Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; They gave us some fresh
camel&rsquo;s milk, the first we have tasted this year.&nbsp; We
then began to descend into a long valley, which here intersects
the Nef&ucirc;d, and in which stand the wells of Shakik.&nbsp;
Close to one of these we now are, camped on a bit of hard ground,
under the first wave of sand beyond the wells.&nbsp; There are
four wells known as Shakik; the one where we now are and another
near it, and two others, three or four miles distant, up and down
the valley.&nbsp; They are all, we hear, of the same depth, two
hundred and twenty-five feet, and are apparently very ancient,
for this one is lined with cut stones, and the edges <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>are worn
through with long usage of ropes in drawing water.&nbsp; There
is, however, here, a little wooden pulley for the rope to pass
over, a permanent arrangement very unusual in the desert, where
everything removable is as a matter of course removed.&nbsp; A
rope or a bucket would have no chance of remaining a week at any
well.&nbsp; There was a dead camel near the well, on which a pair
of vultures and a dog were at work, but nothing else living.</p>
<p>While we were looking over our ropes, and wondering whether we
could make up enough, with all the odds and ends tied together,
to reach to the water, a troop of camels came flourishing down
upon us, cantering with their heads out, and their heels in the
air, and followed by some men on del&uacute;ls.&nbsp; These
proved to be Ibn Shaalan&rsquo;s people, and, to our great
surprise and delight, one of them, a man named Rashid, recognized
us as old acquaintances.&nbsp; We had met him the year before at
the Roala camp at Saikal far away north.&nbsp; He had come, he
said, with Abu Giddeli to our tent, and we remember the
circumstance perfectly.&nbsp; It is pleasant to think of finding
friends in such a place as this, and it shows how far the tribes
wander during the year.&nbsp; Saikal is five hundred miles from
Shakik, as the crow flies.&nbsp; Rashid at once offered to draw
us all the water we wanted, for he had a long rope with him, and
coffee was drunk and dates were eaten by all the party.&nbsp;
Amongst them are two sons of Beneyeh&rsquo;s, Mohammed and Assad,
the <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>elder a shy boorish youth, but the younger, nine years
old, a nice little boy.&nbsp; To him we entrusted our
complimentary message to his father.&nbsp; Beneyeh ibn Heneyfi
ibn Shaalan is the Sheykh of a large section of the Roala, the
very one we heard of last year as having stayed in Nejd.&nbsp; He
is on ill terms with Sotamm on account of a chestnut mare Sotamm
took from him by force, some years ago.&nbsp; The children had
never seen a European in their lives, or been further north than
the Wady Sirh&aacute;n.&nbsp; We should like to pay Beneyeh a
visit, but his tents are many miles out of our way, and we dare
not trifle with the Nef&ucirc;d.</p>
<p>A camel foal was born to-day by the well.&nbsp; I went to look
at the little creature which was left behind with its mother,
when the rest were driven home.&nbsp; I noticed that it had none
of those bare places (callosities) which the older camels get on
their knees and chest from kneeling down, and that its knees were
bruised by its struggles to rise.&nbsp; We helped it up, and in
three hours&rsquo; time it was able to trot away with its
mother.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 15.&mdash;This morning, as I looked out of the
tent, I saw a halo round the moon, and thought there would be
rain; but no such luck has come, though the sky was overcast and
the day sultry.&nbsp; We made a great effort to get off early,
and there was a great deal of &ldquo;yalla, yalla&rdquo; from
Mohammed with very little result, for the men had been
celebrating our passage of the Nef&ucirc;d, which began <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>seriously
to-day, with a final feast on kid, and were dull and slow in
consequence.&nbsp; Wilfrid made them a short speech last night,
about the serious nature of the journey we were undertaking, the
hundred miles of deep sand we have to cross, and the necessity of
husbanding all our strength for the effort.&nbsp; With the best
despatch we can hardly hope to reach Jobba under five days, and
it may be six or seven.&nbsp; No heavily laden caravan such as
ours is, has ever, if we may believe Radi, crossed the
Nef&ucirc;d at this point, and if the camels break down, there
will be no means of getting help, nor is there any well after
Shakik.&nbsp; Abdallah has accordingly been made <i>sheykh of the
water</i>, with orders to dole it out in rations every night, and
allow nobody to drink during the day.&nbsp; The Arabs are very
childish about meat and drink, eating and drinking all day long
if they get the chance, and keeping nothing for the morrow.&nbsp;
But here improvidence can only bring disaster, and we think
Abdallah as well as Mohammed are impressed with the
situation.&nbsp; There is something sobering and solemn in these
great tracts of sand, even for the wildest spirits, and we have
begun our march to-day in very orderly fashion.</p>
<p>Radi, the little guide (his name signifies <i>willing</i>),
has proved a great acquisition to our party, willing to give
every sort of information when asked, and not impertinently
talkative.&nbsp; He is a curious little old man, as dry and black
and withered as the dead stumps of the yerta bushes one sees
here, the <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>driftwood of the Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; He has his
del&uacute;l with him, an ancient bag of bones which looks as if
it would never last through the journey, and on which he sits
perched hour after hour in silence, pointing now and then with
his shrivelled hand towards the road we are to take.&nbsp; He is
carrying with him on his camel one of the red sand-stone mortars
of the J&ocirc;f for a relation of Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s, and this
seems to balance the water-skin hanging on the other side.&nbsp;
From time to time, however, he speaks, and he has told us more
than one interesting tale of those who have perished here in
former days.&nbsp; In almost every hollow there are bones,
generally those of camels, &ldquo;Huseyn&rsquo;s camels,&rdquo;
Radi calls them, and if anybody asks who Huseyn was, there is a
laugh.&nbsp; At the bottom, however, of one fulj there are bones
of another sort.&nbsp; Here a ghaz&uacute; perished,
del&uacute;ls and men.&nbsp; They were Roala who had crossed the
Nef&ucirc;d to make a raid upon the Shammar, and had not been
able to reach Shakik on their way back.&nbsp; The bones were
white, but there were bits of skin still clinging to them, though
Radi says it happened ten years ago.&nbsp; In another place, he
shewed us two heaps of wood, thirty yards apart which mark the
spot where a Shammar which had been lifting camels in the Wady
Sirh&aacute;n, was overtaken by their owner, a Sirhan sheykh, who
had thrown his lance these thirty yards at the akid of the
Shammar and transfixed him, mare and all.&nbsp; Again, he pointed
out the remains of forty Suelmat camel <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>riders, who
had lost their way, and perished of thirst.</p>
<p>The sand, for several miles after leaving the wells, was
covered with camel tracks, Roala camels no doubt, and here and
there we came across the track of a horse, but the further one
gets into Arabia, the rarer horses seem to be.&nbsp; After these
first few miles, however, there appeared no trace of living
creatures except lizards.&nbsp; Radi took us first in a nearly
southerly direction, till he hit a line of landmarks, invisible
to us but well known to him, running-south-south-east.&nbsp; This
he calls <i>the road</i>, the road of Abu Zeyd, and told us the
following legend in connection with it (there was no more trace
of a road than there might have been on the sea).&nbsp; Many
years ago, says Radi, there was a famine in Nejd, and the Beni
Hellal were without bread.&nbsp; Then Abu Zeyd, sheykh of the
tribe, spoke to his kinsmen Merrey and Yunis, and said,
&ldquo;Let us go out towards the west, and seek new pastures for
our people,&rdquo; and they travelled until they came to Tunis
el-Gharb, which was at that time ruled by an Emir named Znati,
and they looked at the land and liked it, and were about to
return to their tribe with the news, when Znati put them all into
prison.&nbsp; Now Znati had a daughter who was very beautiful,
named Sferi, and when she saw Merrey in the dungeon, she fell in
love with him, and proposed that he should marry her, and
promised that his life and all their lives should be
spared.&nbsp; But Merrey did <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>not care for her and would not at
first consent.&nbsp; Still she persisted in her love, and sought
to do them good, and interceded with her father to spare their
lives.&nbsp; Now Znati began to be perplexed with his prisoners,
hearing from his daughter that they were of noble birth, and not
knowing what to do with them.&nbsp; And when she told them this,
they proposed that one of them should be released, and sent home
to bring a ransom for his fellows, but in their hearts they were
determined that Abu Zeyd should be the one sent, and that he
should return, not with a ransom, but with all his people to
Tunis, and so set them free.&nbsp; And Sferi carried the proposal
to her father, and said, &ldquo;Two of these men are of noble
birth, but the third is a slave, but I know not which it
is.&nbsp; Let then the slave go and get ransom for his
masters.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Znati said, &ldquo;How shall we
discover the slave amongst them, and distinguish him from the
others?&rdquo; and she said, &ldquo;By this.&nbsp; Take them to a
muddy place, where there is water, and bid them pass over
it.&nbsp; And you shall see that whichever is the slave amongst
them will gather up his clothes about him carefully, while the
nobly born will let their clothes be soiled.&rdquo;&nbsp; And her
father agreed, and it happened so that on the following day the
three men were brought out of their dungeon, and made to pass
through a muddy stream.&nbsp; And Abu Zeyd, being warned by
Sferi, put his abba on his head, and lifted up his shirt to the
waist, while Merry and Yunis walked through without
precaution.&nbsp; So Abu Zeyd <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>was set free and returned to Nejd,
and gathering all his people together there, he led them across
the Nef&ucirc;d by this very way, making the road we had just
seen, to enable them to come in safety.&nbsp; He then marched on
to Tunis, and laid siege to the town.</p>
<p>Abu Zeyd besieged Tunis for a year but could not enter, and he
never would have taken it, but for Sferi who was plotting for his
success outside.&nbsp; Sferi was a wise woman.&nbsp; She could
read and write, and knew magic and could interpret
prophecies.&nbsp; And there was a prophecy concerning Znati that
he could be killed by no one in battle but by a certain Dib ibn
Ghanim, a robber in the neighbouring desert.&nbsp; And Sferi sent
word of this to Abu Zeyd, who took this robber into his service,
and on the next occasion sent him against Znati when he came out
to fight.&nbsp; And the Emir was slain.</p>
<p>Then Abu Zeyd became Emir of Tunis and Merrey married
Sferi.</p>
<p>Such is Radi&rsquo;s story, which it may be hoped is not
exactly true as to Sferi&rsquo;s betrayal of her father.&nbsp; As
to the road legend, it is impossible to say that the road is
there &ldquo;to witness if he lies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Road or no road
we have been wandering about in zigzags all day long, sometimes
toiling up steep slopes, at others making a long circuit to avoid
a fulj, and sometimes meandering for no particular reason yet
always on a perfectly untrodden surface of yielding sand.&nbsp;
The ground is more broken than ever, the fuljes bigger and the
travelling harder.&nbsp; But both mares and <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>camels have
marched bravely, and we have got over about twenty-one miles
to-day.&nbsp; Our camp this evening, though in a fulj, is five
hundred and sixty feet higher than the wells of Shakik.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 16.&mdash;A thunderstorm in the night which has
turned the sand crimson.&nbsp; Radi congratulates us upon this,
as he says now we shall get to Jobba, inshallah!&nbsp; He seems
to have been a little doubtful before.&nbsp; But the heavy rain
has hardened the ground, and we have been able to push on at
almost as good a rate as if we had been travelling on
gravel.&nbsp; As we get deeper into the Nef&ucirc;d, the fuljes
are further apart and the cross ridges lower.&nbsp; The fuljes
seem to run in pretty regular strings from east to west, or
rather from east by south to west by north.&nbsp; It is
interesting to observe the footmarks of wild animals on the sand,
for they are now clearly marked as on fresh fallen snow.&nbsp;
The most common are those of hares answering in size to our
rabbits at home, and to-day the greyhounds have put up and
coursed several of them, though quite in vain, for the ghada
trees and bushes soon screen them from the dogs.&nbsp; We have
had a gallop or two, and there is no danger of losing ourselves,
for we only have to go back on our footsteps to find the
caravan.&nbsp; Besides the hares there are several sorts of small
birds, linnets, wrens, desert larks, wheatears, and occasionally
crows.&nbsp; I also saw a pair of kestrels evidently quite at
home.&nbsp; Reptiles are still much more numerous, the whole
surface of <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>the desert being marked with lizard tracks, while here
and there was the trail of a snake.&nbsp; Our people killed two
to-day of the sort called <i>suliman</i>, common in most parts of
the desert, a long, slim, silvery snake, with a little head, and
quite harmless.&nbsp; The warm sunshine after the rain had
brought them out.&nbsp; We have been inquiring of Radi after the
more dangerous species, and he describes very accurately the
horned viper and the cobra.&nbsp; I was surprised to hear of the
latter, but it is impossible to mistake his description of a
snake which stands on its tail, and swells out its neck like
wings.&nbsp; These, he says, are only seen in the summer.&nbsp;
Gazelles there seem to be none in the Nef&ucirc;d, but we crossed
the quite fresh track of two &ldquo;wild cows&rdquo;
(antelope).&nbsp; This animal, Radi assures us, never leaves the
Nef&ucirc;d and never drinks.&nbsp; Indeed there is no water here
above ground anywhere nearer than Jebel Aja, and it must be able
to do without.&nbsp; The slot was about the size of a red deer
fully grown.&nbsp; We are very anxious to see the beast itself,
which they assure us is a real cow, though that can hardly
be.&nbsp; We have also kept a good look-out for ostriches but
without result.&nbsp; In the way of insects, we have seen a few
flies like houseflies, and some dragonflies and small
butterflies.&nbsp; There is a much better sort of grass in the
Nef&ucirc;d and more of it than on the outskirts, which I suppose
is from the absence of camels.</p>
<p>I find that Radi makes out his course almost entirely by
landmarks.&nbsp; On every high sand-hill he <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>gets down
from his del&uacute;l, and pulls some ghada branches, which are
very brittle, and adds them to piles of wood he has formerly
made.&nbsp; These can be seen a good way off.&nbsp; We have
learned, too, to make out a sort of road after all, of an
intermittent kind, marked by the dung of camels, and occasionally
on the side of a steep slope there is a distinct footway.&nbsp;
Along this line our guide feels his way, here and there making a
cast, as hounds do when they are off the scent.&nbsp; Neither he
nor Mohammed, nor any of the Arabs with us, have the least notion
of steering by the sun, and when Wilfrid asked Mohammed if he
thought he could find his way back to Shakik, he answered,
&ldquo;How could I do so?&nbsp; Every one of these sand-hills is
like the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have been entertained by Radi with more blood and bones
stories, the most terrible of which is that of some Turkish
soldiers, <a name="citation174"></a><a href="#footnote174"
class="citation">[174]</a> who many years ago were treacherously
abandoned in the Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; They had occupied Ha&iuml;l
in the days of the first Ibn Rashid, and had been left there as a
garrison.&nbsp; But either the Sultan could not communicate with
them or forgot them, and after a certain time they wished to go
home.&nbsp; Many of them had died at Ha&iuml;l, and the remainder
of them, about five hundred, easily agreed to set out for
Damascus under the escort of Obeyd, the Emir&rsquo;s brother, who
had resolved to destroy them.&nbsp; They left Ha&iuml;l on
horseback and <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>followed their Shammar guides to this place, who to all
questions as to where they should find wells, answered, a little
further, a little further on.&nbsp; At last the Bedouins left
them.&nbsp; They seem to have been brave fellows, for the last
that was heard of them was a sort of song or chorus which they
sang as they struggled on, &ldquo;Nahnu askar ma nahnu
at&acirc;sha nahnu askar ma benr&iacute;d moyeh.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;We are not thirsty, we soldiers want no
water.&rdquo;&nbsp; But at noon that day they must have lost
heart, and lain down under the bushes to get a sort of shade, and
so they were afterwards found scattered about in the different
fuljes.&nbsp; Some of their horses made their way back to Jobba,
and became the property of any who could seize them.&nbsp; They
were sold by these lucky people for a few sheep or goats
each.&nbsp; It is a ghastly tale.</p>
<p>A pleasanter one is that of two young lovers who eloped from
J&ocirc;f, and were pursued by their relations.&nbsp; Suspecting
that they would be tracked, and to avoid scandal, they had agreed
that instead of walking together, they would keep parallel lines
about a hundred yards apart and so set out on their journey, and
when they came to a certain fulj, which Radi pointed out to us,
they were too tired and lay down to die each under his
bush.&nbsp; Thus they were found and fortunately in time, and
their discretion so pleased the relations on both sides, that
consent was given to their marriage, and the nuptials celebrated
with rejoicings.</p>
<p>At half-past ten we suddenly caught sight of the <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>peaks of
Aalem, two conical rocks which jut out of the sand, and make a
conspicuous landmark for travellers on their way to Jobba.&nbsp;
It was an immense relief to see them, for we had begun to
distrust the sagacity of our guide on account of the tortuous
line we followed, and now we knew that the worst was over, and
that if need were, we could find our way on across the other half
of the Nef&ucirc;d, with some prospect at least of success.&nbsp;
We left our camels to follow, and rode on towards the
hills.&nbsp; It still took us several hours to reach them, but we
were by three o&rsquo;clock touching the stones with our hands to
feel that they were real.&nbsp; It was as if we had been lost at
sea and had found a desert island.</p>
<p>We had some time to wait while the caravan laboured slowly on
to join us.&nbsp; I remained with the mares and kept a look-out
while Wilfrid climbed to the top of the smaller rock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What a place to be buried in,&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mount Nebo must have been like this.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
people who die in the Nef&ucirc;d have seldom anyone to bury
them.&nbsp; As he clambered round the pile of loose stones near
the top of the tell, he found to his great delight a painted lady
butterfly sunning itself in a sheltered spot.&nbsp; If, as is
probable, there is no vegetation suited for the caterpillar of
this butterfly nearer than Hebron, this little insect must have
travelled at least four hundred miles.&nbsp; Here it seemed happy
in the sun.&nbsp; This smaller rock, or rocky hill, was just a
hundred feet from the level of the plain, <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>and rose
sheer out of it bare and naked as a rock does at sea.&nbsp; The
barometer at the top of it shewed 3220 feet.&nbsp; The taller
Aalem is perhaps three times its height.</p>
<p>Aalem, Radi says, is Sheykh of the Nef&ucirc;d, and the little
tell is his son.&nbsp; At some miles distance to the north-east
there is a cluster of white sand-hills, Aalem&rsquo;s
&ldquo;harim.&rdquo;&nbsp; The rocks of Aalem are sandstone
weathered black, not granite as we had hoped, and this no doubt
is the material from which in the lapse of years the great red
sand heaps have been formed.&nbsp; They are not of solid rock but
resemble heaps of stones.&nbsp; On the top of the one Wilfrid
ascended was a cairn with the remains of some old letters
scratched on the stones, of the same kind as those to be seen on
Sinai, or rather in the Wady Mokattib.&nbsp; The view was, by
Wilfrid&rsquo;s report, stupendous, but one impossible to draw or
even attempt to draw.&nbsp; Here could be seen spread out as on a
map the general features of the Nef&ucirc;d, the uniformity of
the ocean of sand streaked with the long lines of its fuljes,
Aalem itself rising in their midst like a rock out of a sea
streaked with foam.</p>
<p>We are now encamped about two miles beyond Aalem.&nbsp; I have
filled a bottle with sand to make an hour-glass with at home.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 17.&mdash;A white frost, some of which was
packed up with the tents and carried with us all day.</p>
<p><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>It is
curious that now we have passed Aalem the vegetation has
changed.&nbsp; Up to that point the ghada reigned supreme, and I
could not have believed it could so suddenly disappear, yet such
is the case.&nbsp; Now not a bush of ghada is to be seen, and its
place is taken by the yerta which before was rare.&nbsp; It seems
impossible to account for this, as there is no material change of
level, and absolutely no change in the character of the
soil.&nbsp; The bushes by which we camped last night were quite
the last southwards.&nbsp; We are sorry to lose them, as ghada is
the finest firewood in the world.&nbsp; Charcoal made from it,
which one finds here and there where there has been a camp fire,
is finer than the finest charcoal used for drawing.&nbsp; The
yerta is inferior.&nbsp; On the other hand there is more of the
grass called <i>nass&iacute;</i> for the camels, and of the
hamar, a whitish-blue prickly plant which the mares are very fond
of, while the <i>adr</i>, a shrub with stiff green leaves and
brownish yellow flowers, is still the commonest plant.</p>
<p>The sand has dried again since yesterday, and as the day grew
warmer became very heavy for the camels.&nbsp; The labour of
trudging through the yielding surface is beginning to tell on
them, and to-day most of our men have walked, Mohammed giving the
example.&nbsp; Every one was cheerful, in spite of the hard work,
and all showed wonderful strength in running on and playing
pranks in the sand.&nbsp; Wilfrid, who is in fair training, was
quite <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>unable to keep up with them, and I fared still worse as
may be imagined, being as yet very lame; we both, however, felt
bound to try and walk at intervals for the sake of our
mares.&nbsp; Ibrahim el-taw&icirc;l (the tall as contrasted with
Ibrahim el-kas&iacute;r, or the short), who has hitherto been the
butt of the party, being sent down on fools&rsquo; errands to
fetch water from fuljes, and up to the tops of sand-hills, to see
imaginary mountains, has proved himself to-day most
valiant.&nbsp; He, although a Christian, is a match for any
Moslem of the party, and gives as much as he takes in the rough
games the Arabs indulge in to keep up their spirits.&nbsp; At one
moment he got hold of the servants&rsquo; tent pole, a very heavy
one, and played at quarter-staff with it among them to such
effect, that I thought there would have been bones broken.&nbsp;
Abdallah, too, when there is any particularly hard piece of
climbing to do and the rest seem fagged, generally runs on and
stands on his head till they come up.&nbsp; We encourage this
mirth as it makes the work lighter.</p>
<p>Our water is now running rather short, for we have had to
divide a skin among the mares each day, but this lightens the
loads.&nbsp; Two of the camels are beginning to flag,
Hanna&rsquo;s del&uacute;l, which has hardly had fair play, as he
and Ibrahim have been constantly changing places on its back, and
making a camel kneel and get up repeatedly tires it more than any
weight; also the beautiful camel we <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>bought at Mez&aacute;rib.&nbsp; This
last, in spite of his good looks, seems to be weakly.&nbsp; His
legs are a trifle long, and his neck a trifle short, two bad
points for endurance, and then he is only a three year old and
has not had the distemper, at least so Abdallah says.&nbsp; A
camel can never be depended on till he has had it.&nbsp; The ugly
camel, too, which they call Shenuan, seems distressed.&nbsp; He
has certainly got the mange, and I wish we had insisted on this
point when we suspected the camels at Damascus, but it is too
late now.&nbsp; The rest are still in fine order, in spite of the
long journey and the absence of fresh pasture, which at this time
of year they require.&nbsp; Nothing green has yet appeared,
except a diminutive plant like a nemophila, with a purple flower
which is beginning to show its head above the sand.&nbsp; Fresh
grass there is none, and last year&rsquo;s crop stands white and
withered still without sign of life.</p>
<p>We met a man to-day, a Roala, alone with twelve camels,
yearlings and two year olds, which he had bought from the Shammar
and was driving home.&nbsp; He had paid twenty-five to
thirty-five mejidies apiece for them, but they were scraggy
beasts.&nbsp; The Nejd camels are nearly all black, and very
inferior in size and strength to those of the north.&nbsp; When
we came upon the man we at first supposed he might be an enemy,
for anybody here is likely to be that, and Awwad rushed valiantly
at him with a gun, frightening him out of his wits and summoning
him in a terrible voice to give an <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>account of himself.&nbsp; He was
perfectly harmless and unarmed, and had been three nights out
already in the Nef&ucirc;d by himself.&nbsp; He had a skin of
water and a skin of dates, and was going to Shakik, a lonely
walk.</p>
<p>At half-past three (level 3040 feet) we caught sight of the
hills of Jobba, and from the same point could just see
Aalem.&nbsp; It was a good occasion for correcting our reckoning,
so we took the directions accurately with the compass, and made
out our course to be exactly south by east.</p>
<p>To-day all our Mahometans have begun to say their prayers, for
the first time during the journey.&nbsp; The solemnity of the
Nef&ucirc;d, or perhaps a doubt about reaching Jobba, might well
make them serious; perhaps, however, they merely want to get into
training for Nejd, where Wahhabism prevails and prayers are in
fashion.&nbsp; Whatever be the cause, Mohammed on the top of a
sand-hill was bowing and kneeling towards Mecca with great
appearance of earnestness, and Awwad recited prayers in a still
more impressive manner, raising his voice almost to a chant.</p>
<p>Talking by the camp fire tonight, Radi informs us that the
Nef&ucirc;d extends twelve days&rsquo; journey to the east of
where we now are, and eleven days&rsquo; journey to the
west.&nbsp; At the edge of it westwards, lies Teyma, an oasis
like J&ocirc;f, where there is a wonderful well, the best in
Arabia.&nbsp; We asked him about sandstorms, and whether caravans
were ever buried <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>by them.&nbsp; He said they were not.&nbsp; The sand
never buries any object deeply, as we can judge by the sticks and
bones and camel-dung which always remain on the surface.&nbsp;
The only danger for caravans is that a storm may last so long
that their provision of water fails them, for they cannot travel
when it is severe.&nbsp; Of the simum, or poisonous wind spoken
of by travellers, he has never heard, though he has been
travelling to and fro in the Nef&ucirc;d for forty years.&nbsp;
Abdallah, however, says he has heard of it at Tudmur, as of a
thing occurring now and again.&nbsp; None of them have ever
experienced it.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 18.&mdash;A calm night with slight fog, hoar
frost in the morning.</p>
<p>It appears that there was a scout or spy about our camp in the
night from the Shammar.&nbsp; We had been sighted in the
afternoon, and he had crept up in the dark to find out who we
were.&nbsp; At first he thought we were a ghaz&uacute;, but
afterwards recognised Radi&rsquo;s voice, and knew we must be
travellers going to Ibn Rashid.&nbsp; He came in the morning and
told us this; and that he was out on a scouting expedition to
look for grass in the Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; He seemed rather
frightened, and very anxious to please; and assured us over and
over again that Mohammed Ibn Rashid would be delighted to see
us.</p>
<p>It has been another hard day for the camels.&nbsp; Shenuan has
broken down and cannot carry his load; and Hanna, like the rest
of the men, has had to walk, for his del&uacute;l is giving
in.&nbsp; The sand seems <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>to get deeper and deeper; and though
we have been at work from dawn to dusk, we are still ten or
fifteen miles from Jobba.&nbsp; But for the hills which we see
before us every time we rise to the crest of a wave, it would be
very hopeless work.&nbsp; Every one is serious to-night.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, <i>January</i> 19.&mdash;A terrible day for
camels and men.&nbsp; Hanna&rsquo;s del&uacute;l, Shenuan, and
the tall camel they call &ldquo;Am&uacute;d,&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;Pillar,&rdquo; refused their aliek last night, being too
thirsty to eat; and to-day they could carry no loads.&nbsp;
Shakran, too, who has hitherto been one of our best walkers,
lagged behind; and the whole pace of the caravan has been little
over a mile an hour.&nbsp; But for the extraordinary strength of
Hather&aacute;n, the gigantic camel which leads the procession,
and on whom most of the extra loads have been piled, we should
have had to abandon a great part of our property; and, indeed, at
one moment it seemed as if we should remain altogether in the
Nef&ucirc;d, adding a new chapter to old Radi&rsquo;s tales of
horror.&nbsp; And now that we have escaped such a fate and have
reached Jobba, we can see how fortunate we have been.&nbsp; But
for the perfect travelling weather throughout our passage of the
Nef&ucirc;d, and the extraordinary luck of that thunderstorm, we
should not now be at Jobba.&nbsp; The sand to tired camels is
like a prison, and in the sand we should have remained.&nbsp;
Mohammed, Abdallah, and the rest all behaved like heroes; even
old Hanna, with stray <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>locks of grey hair hanging from
under his kefiyeh, for he has grown grey on the journey, and his
feet bare, for it is impossible to walk in shoes, trudged on as
valiantly as the most robust of the party.&nbsp; All were
cheerful and uncomplaining, though the usual songs had ceased,
and they talked but little.</p>
<p>Wilfrid and I were the only ones who rode at all, except
Hanna, whom Wilfrid forced to ride his mare from time to time,
and we were the gloomiest of the party.&nbsp; We felt annoyed at
being unable to do our work on foot with the others; though from
time to time we walked or rather waded through the sand, until
obliged to remount for lack of breath and strength.&nbsp; Neither
of us could have kept up on foot; but a European is no match for
even a town Arab in the matter of walking.</p>
<p>To-day the <i>khall Abu Zeyd</i> (Abu Zeyd&rsquo;s road) was
distinctly traceable, and we begin to think that it may not have
been altogether a romance.&nbsp; There are regular cuttings in
some places, and the track is often well marked for half a mile
together.&nbsp; Radi assures us that there is a road of stone
under the sand; of stone brought from Jebel Shammar at, I am
afraid to say, what expense of camels and men, who died in the
work.&nbsp; I noticed to-day a buzzard and a grey shrike; and a
couple of wolves had run along the road, as one could see by
their footmarks and the scratching on the sand.</p>
<p>The level of the Nef&ucirc;d had been rising all day, and at
one o&rsquo;clock we were 3300 feet above the <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>sea.&nbsp;
From this point we had a large view southwards, sand, all sand
still for many a mile; but close before us the group of islands
we had so long been steering for, the rocks of Jobba.&nbsp; The
nearest was not two miles off.&nbsp; We could see nothing of the
oasis, for it was on the other side of the hills; but we could
make out a wide space bare of sand, which looked like a subbkha,
and beyond this a further group of rocks of exceedingly fantastic
outline, rising out of the sand.&nbsp; It was like a scene on
some great glacier in the Alps.&nbsp; Beyond again, lay a faint
blue line of hills.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jebel Shammar.&nbsp; Those are
the hills of Nejd,&rdquo; said Radi.&nbsp; They were what we have
come so far to see.</p>
<p>We made haste now to get to the rocks, and reached them at
half-past three.&nbsp; They were of the same character as Aalem,
sand and ironstone.&nbsp; There Wilfrid took a map, and I a
sketch, and we waited till the camels came up; a doleful string
they were as we looked down from the top of our rocky hill at
them passing below.&nbsp; Shenuan and Am&uacute;d toiled on with
only their saddles, and the poor black del&uacute;l, absolutely
bare and hardly able to walk, was fifty yards behind, urged along
by Abdallah.&nbsp; We still had some miles to go to get to Jobba,
but on harder ground and all down hill; and Mohammed proposed
that we three should ride on, and prepare a place for the camels
in the village.&nbsp; On our way we saw what we thought was a
cloud of smoke moving from west to east, and the tail of it
passed over us.&nbsp; We found <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>it was a flight of locusts in the
red stage of their existence, which the people here prefer for
eating, but we did not care to stop now to gather them, and rode
on.&nbsp; It was nearly sunset when we first saw Jobba itself,
below us at the edge of the subbkha, with dark green palms
cutting the pale blue of the dry lake, and beyond that a group of
red rocks rising out of the pink Nef&ucirc;d; in the foreground
yellow sand tufted with adr; the whole scene transfigured by the
evening light, and beautiful beyond description.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Jobba&mdash;An unpleasant dream&mdash;We hear
strange tales of Ibn Rashid&mdash;Romping in the
Nef&ucirc;d&mdash;A last night there&mdash;The Zodiacal
light&mdash;We enter Nejd&mdash;The granite range of Jebel
Shammar.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jobba</span> is one of the most curious
places in the world, and to my mind one of the most
beautiful.&nbsp; Its name Jobba, or rather Jubbeh, meaning a
well, explains its position, for it lies in a hole or well in the
Nef&ucirc;d; not indeed in a fulj, for the basin of Jobba is on
quite another scale, and has nothing in common with the
horse-hoof depressions I have hitherto described.&nbsp; It is,
all the same, extremely singular, and quite as difficult to
account for geologically as the fuljes.&nbsp; It is a great bare
space in the ocean of sand, from four hundred to five hundred
feet below its average level, and about three miles wide; a
hollow, in fact, not unlike that of J&ocirc;f, but with the
Nef&ucirc;d round it instead of sandstone cliffs.&nbsp; That it
has once been a lake is pretty evident, for there are distinct
water marks on the rocks which <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>crop up out of its bed just above
the town; and, strange to say, there is a tradition still extant
of there having formerly been water there.&nbsp; The wonder is
how this space is kept clear of sand.&nbsp; What force is it that
walls out the Nef&ucirc;d and prevents encroachment?&nbsp; As you
look across the subbkha or dry bed of the lake, the Nef&ucirc;d
seems like a wall of water which must overwhelm it, and yet no
sand shifts down into the hollow, and its limits are accurately
maintained.</p>
<p>The town itself (or village, for it has only eighty houses) is
built on the edge of the subbkha, 2860 feet above the sea, and
has the same sort of palm gardens we saw at J&ocirc;f, only on a
very small scale.&nbsp; The wells from which these are watered
are seventy-five feet deep, and are worked, like all the wells in
Arabia, by camels.&nbsp; The village is extremely picturesque,
with its little battlemented walls and its gardens.&nbsp; At the
entrance stand half a dozen fine old ithel-trees with gnarled
trunks and feathery branches.&nbsp; The rocks towering above are
very grand, being of purple sandstone streaked and veined with
yellow, and having an upper facing of black.&nbsp; They are from
seven hundred to eight hundred feet high, and their bases are
scored with old water marks.&nbsp; Wilfrid found several
inscriptions in the Sina&iuml;tic character upon them.&nbsp;
Jobba is backed by these hills, and by a strip of yellow sand,
like the dunes of Ithery, on which just now there are brilliantly
green tufts of adr in full leaf.&nbsp; Beyond the subbkha the
rocks of <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>Ghota rising out of the Nef&ucirc;d remind one of the
Aletsch Glacier, as seen from the Simplon Road.</p>
<p>So much for the outer face of Jobba.&nbsp; The interior is
less attractive.&nbsp; The houses are very poor, and less smartly
kept than those of K&acirc;f and Ithery.&nbsp; I can hardly call
them dirty, for dirt in this region of sand is almost an
impossibility.&nbsp; It is one of the luxuries of the Nef&ucirc;d
that no noxious insects are found within its circuit.&nbsp; The
Nef&ucirc;d and, indeed, Nejd, which lies beyond it, are free
from those creatures which make life a torment in other districts
of the East.&nbsp; Even the fleas on our greyhounds died as soon
as they entered the enchanted circle of red sand.&nbsp; But Jobba
would be dirty if it could; and its inhabitants are the least
well-mannered of all the Arabs we saw in Nejd.&nbsp; The fact is,
the people are very poor and have no communication with the outer
world, except when the rare travellers between Ha&iuml;l and
J&ocirc;f stop a night among them.&nbsp; At the time of our
passage through Jobba, the Sheykh had lately died, and his office
was being held by a young man of two or three and twenty, who had
no authority with his fellow-youths, a noisy, good-for-nothing
set.&nbsp; Ibn Rashid has no special lieutenant at Jobba, and the
young Sheykh Na&iuml;f was unsupported by any representative of
the central government, even a policeman.&nbsp; The consequence
was that though entertained hospitably enough by Na&iuml;f, we
were considerably pestered by his friends, and made to feel not a
little <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>uncomfortable.&nbsp; I quote this as a single instance
of incivility in a country where politeness is very much the
rule.</p>
<p>The style of our entertainment at Na&iuml;f&rsquo;s house
requires no special mention, as it differed in no respect from
what we had already received elsewhere.&nbsp; There was a great
deal of coffee drinking, and a great deal of talk.&nbsp; Wherever
one goes in Arabia one only has to march into any house one
pleases, and one is sure to be welcome.&nbsp; The kahwah stands
open all day long, and the arrival of a guest is the signal for
these two forms of indulgence, coffee and conversation, the only
ones known to the Arabs.&nbsp; A fire is instantly lighted, and
the coffee cups in due course are handed round.&nbsp; One curious
incident, however, of our stay at Jobba must be related.</p>
<p>For some days before our arrival there Mohammed, who was
usually careless enough about the dangers of the road, had
betrayed considerable uneasiness whenever there was a question of
meeting Arabs on the way or making new acquaintances.&nbsp; He
had dissuaded us more than once from looking about for tents; and
when we had met the solitary man with the camels and the man we
called the spy, he had given very short answers to their
inquiries of who we were, and where we were going.&nbsp; It was
not till the evening of our arrival at Jobba that he explained
the cause of his anxiety.&nbsp; It then appeared that Radi in the
course of conversation had mentioned the name of a certain
Shammar Sheykh, one Ibn <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>Ermal, as being in the
neighbourhood, and Mohammed had remembered that many years ago a
Sheykh of that name had made a raid against Tudmur.&nbsp; There
had been some fighting, and a man or two killed on the Shammar
side; and this was enough to make it extremely probable that a
blood-feud might be still unsettled between his family and the
Ibn Ermals.&nbsp; He therefore begged us not to mention his name
in Jobba, or the fact that he and Abdallah were Tudmur men.&nbsp;
He had the more reason for this because he had discovered that
Na&iuml;f, our host, was himself related to the Ibn Ermals; and
it was fortunate that Tudmur had not yet been mentioned by any
one in conversation.&nbsp; Later on in the evening he came to us
very radiant, with the news that we need no longer be under any
apprehension.&nbsp; He had managed ingeniously to lead the
conversation with Na&iuml;f to the subject he had at heart, and
had just learned that the blood-feud was considered at an
end.&nbsp; Mohammed ibn Rashid, before he came to the Sheykhat of
Jebel Shammar, was Emir el-Haj, or Prince of the pilgrimage to
Mecca, a position of honour and profit, under his brother
Tell&aacute;l, and in that capacity had made acquaintance with
several Tudmuri at the holy cities, and when he succeeded to the
Sheykhat he had good-naturedly composed their difference with his
people.&nbsp; He had either paid the blood-money himself, or had
used pressure on Ibn Ermal to forego his revenge, and the
blood-feud had been declared <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>cancelled.&nbsp; Whatever the
Emir&rsquo;s reason for acting thus as peace maker, it was a very
fortunate circumstance for us, and now Mohammed and Na&iuml;f
were the best of friends.&nbsp; On the morning, however, of our
departure from Jobba (we stayed there two nights), Na&iuml;f in
wishing Mohammed good bye, narrated that he had had a curious
dream that night.&nbsp; He had gone to sleep, he said, thinking
of this old feud; and in his sleep he thought he heard a voice
reproaching him with having neglected his duty of taking just
revenge on the man who was his guest, and he had been much
distressed between the conflicting duties of vengeance and
hospitality, so that he had got up in his sleep to feel about for
his sword, and had found himself doing this when he woke.&nbsp;
Then he had remembered that the feud was at an end, and said El
hamdu lillah, and went to sleep again.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a
dreadful thing it would have been,&rdquo; he said to Mohammed at
the end of this story, &ldquo;if I had been obliged to kill you,
you, my guest!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mohammed, however, maintained to us
that even if the blood-feud had not been settled, Na&iuml;f would
not have been bound to do anything, once he had eaten and drunk
with him in his house.&nbsp; Such, at least, would be the rule at
Tudmur, though morals might be stricter in Nejd.</p>
<p>We only stayed, as I have said, two nights with
Na&iuml;f.&nbsp; The young people of the village were inquisitive
and obtrusive, and we were obliged to make a sort of scene with
our host about it, a thing <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>which is disagreeable, but sometimes
necessary.&nbsp; I dare say they meant no harm, but their manners
were bad, and there was something almost hostile in their tone
about Nasrani (Nazarenes or Christians), which it was advisable
to check.&nbsp; I am glad to say that this is the only instance
we have had in Arabia of unpleasant allusions to religion.&nbsp;
The Arabs are by nature tolerant to the last degree on this
point, and national or religious prejudices are exceedingly
rare.</p>
<p>This little episode, however, made us rather anxious about our
possible reception at Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; No European nor Christian
of any sort had penetrated as such before us to Jebel Shammar,
and all we knew of the people and country was the recollection of
Mr. Palgrave&rsquo;s account of his visit there in disguise
sixteen years before.&nbsp; Ibn Rashid, for all we knew, might be
as ill-disposed towards us as these Jobbites here, and it was
clear that, without his countenance and protection, we should be
running considerable risk in entering Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; Still, the
die was cast.&nbsp; We had crossed our Rubicon, the Red Desert,
and there was no turning back.&nbsp; There was nothing to be done
but to put a good face on things and proceed on our way.&nbsp; We
cross questioned Radi as to the state of affairs at Ha&iuml;l,
and I may as well give here the whole of the information he gave
us, corroborated and amplified by subsequent narrators.&nbsp; The
main facts we learned from him.</p>
<p>Radi, in the first place, confirmed in general <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>terms the
account we had already heard of the history of the Ibn Rashid
family.&nbsp; About fifty years ago, Abdallah ibn Rashid, at that
time &ldquo;a mere <i>zellem</i>,&rdquo; individual, of the Abde
section of the Shammar tribe, took service with the Ibn Saouds of
Upper Nejd, and was appointed lieutenant of Jebel Shammar, by the
Wahhabi Emir.&nbsp; He was a great warrior, and reduced the whole
country to order with the help of his brother Obeyd, the
principal hero of Shammar tradition.&nbsp; Of Obeyd we heard
nothing to confirm the evil tales mentioned by Mr.
Palgrave.&nbsp; On the contrary, he has left a great reputation
among the Arabs for his hospitality, generosity, and courage, the
three cardinal virtues of their creed.&nbsp; He was never
actually Emir of Jebel Shammar, but after his brother&rsquo;s
death he virtually ruled the country.&nbsp; It was he that
counselled the destruction of the Turkish soldiers in the
Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; He lived to a great age, and died only nine
years ago, having been paralysed from the waist downwards for
some months before his death.&nbsp; It is related of him that he
left no property behind him, having given away everything during
his lifetime&mdash;no property but his sword, his mare, and his
young wife.&nbsp; These he left to his nephew Mohammed, ibn
Rashid, the reigning Emir, with the request that his sword should
remain undrawn, his mare unridden, and his wife unmarried for
ever afterwards.&nbsp; Ibn Rashid has respected his uncle&rsquo;s
first two wishes, but he has taken the wife into his own
harim.</p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>Abdallah ibn Rashid died in 1843, and was succeeded in
the Sheykhat of the Shammar and the lieutenancy of Ha&iuml;l, by
his son Tell&aacute;l, who took the title of Emir, and made
himself nearly independent of the Wahhabi government.&nbsp; There
is not much talk at Ha&iuml;l now about Tell&aacute;l.&nbsp; He
has left behind him little of the reputation one would expect
from Mr. Palgrave&rsquo;s account of him.&nbsp; In his time, his
second brother and successor, Metaab, conquered J&ocirc;f and
Ithery, and Metaab&rsquo;s name is much more frequently mentioned
than Tell&aacute;l&rsquo;s.&nbsp; About twelve years ago
Tell&aacute;l went out of his mind and committed suicide.&nbsp;
He stabbed himself at Ha&iuml;l with his own dagger.&nbsp; He
left behind him several sons, the eldest of whom was Bender, and
two brothers, Metaab and Mohammed, besides his uncle Obeyd, then
a very old man, and several cousins.&nbsp; Bender was quite a boy
at the time, and Metaab succeeded Tell&aacute;l with the approval
of all the family.&nbsp; Metaab, however, only ruled for three
years, and dying rather suddenly, a dispute arose as to the
succession.&nbsp; Mohammed, who for some years had been acting as
Emir el-Haj, or leader of the pilgrims, was away from Ha&iuml;l,
settling a matter connected with his office with Ibn Saoud at
Riad, and Bender, being now twenty years old, was proclaimed
Emir.&nbsp; He was supported by all the family except Mohammed
and Ham&uacute;d, Obeyd&rsquo;s eldest son, who had been brought
up with Mohammed as a brother.&nbsp; Mohammed, when he heard of
this, was very angry, and for many days, so <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>Radi told
us, sat with his kefiyeh over his face like one in grief, and
refused to speak with anyone.&nbsp; He remained at Riad,
rejecting all Bender&rsquo;s advances and invitations until Obeyd
was dead, when he consented to return to Ha&iuml;l, and resume
his post with the Haj.&nbsp; This post brought him in much money,
and he was fond of money.&nbsp; But he plotted all the while for
the Sheykhat, intriguing with the Sherar&acirc;t and other
Bedouins under Bender&rsquo;s rule.&nbsp; It was in this way that
he ultimately gratified his ambition, for it happened one day
that a caravan of Sherar&acirc;t came to Ha&iuml;l to buy dates,
and placed themselves under Mohammed&rsquo;s protection instead
of the Emir&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This made Bender very angry, and he
sent for Mohammed, and asked him the meaning of this
insolence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you Sheykh,&rdquo; he asked,
&ldquo;or am I?&rdquo;&nbsp; He then mounted his mare and rode
out, threatening to confiscate the Sherar&acirc;t camels, for
they were encamped under the walls of Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; But
Mohammed followed him, and riding with him, a violent dispute
arose, in which Mohammed drew his <i>shabriyeh</i> (a crooked
dagger they all wear in Nejd), and stabbed his nephew, who fell
dead on the spot.&nbsp; Then Mohammed galloped back to the
castle, and, finding Ham&uacute;d there, got his help and took
possession of the place.&nbsp; He then seized the younger sons of
Tell&aacute;l, Bender&rsquo;s brothers, all but one child,
Na&iuml;f, and Bedr, who was away from Ha&iuml;l, and had their
heads cut off by his slaves in the courtyard of the castle.&nbsp;
They say, however, that Ham&uacute;d <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>protested against this.&nbsp; But
Mohammed was reckless, or wished to strike terror, and not
satisfied with what he had already done, went on destroying his
relations.&nbsp; He had some cousins, sons of Jabar, a younger
brother of Abdallah and Obeyd; and these he sent for.&nbsp; They
came in some alarm to the castle, each with his slave.&nbsp; They
were all young men, beautiful to look at, and of the highest
distinction; and their slaves had been brought up with them, as
the custom is, more like brothers than servants.&nbsp; They were
shown into the kahwah of the castle, and received with great
formality, Mohammed&rsquo;s servants coming forward to invite
them in.&nbsp; It is the custom at Ha&iuml;l, whenever a person
pays a visit, that before sitting down, he should hang up his
sword on one of the wooden pegs fixed into the wall, and this the
sons of Jabar did, and their slaves likewise.&nbsp; Then they sat
down, and waited and waited, but still no coffee was served to
them.&nbsp; At last Mohammed appeared surrounded by his guard,
but there was no &ldquo;salaam aleykum,&rdquo; and instantly he
gave orders that his cousins should be seized and bound.&nbsp;
They made a rush for their swords, but were intercepted by the
slaves of the castle, and made prisoners.&nbsp; Mohammed then,
with horrible barbarity, ordered their hands and their feet to be
cut off, and the hands and the feet of their slaves and had them,
still living, dragged out into the courtyard of the palace, where
they lay till they died.&nbsp; These ghastly crimes, more ghastly
than ever <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>in a country where wilful bloodshed is so unusual, seem
to have struck terror far and wide, and no one has since dared to
raise a hand against Mohammed.&nbsp; Now he is said to have
repented of his crimes, and to be &ldquo;angry with
himself&rdquo; for what he has done.&nbsp; But Radi is of opinion
that Heaven is at least as angry, for though Mohammed has married
over and over again, he has never been blessed with a son, nor
even with a daughter.&nbsp; His rule, however, apart from its
evil commencement, though firm, has been beneficent.&nbsp; The
only other persons, with one exception, who have suffered death
during his reign, have been highway robbers, and these are now
extirpated within three hundred miles of Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; A
traveller may go about securely in any part of the desert with
all his gold in his hand, and he will not be molested.&nbsp;
Neither are there thieves in the towns.&nbsp; He has made Jebel
Shammar definitely independent of Riad, and has resisted one or
two attempted encroachments by the Turks.&nbsp; He is munificent
to all, and exercises unbounded hospitality.&nbsp; No man, rich
or poor, is ever sent away from his gate unfed, and seldom
without a present of clothes or money; and hospitality in Arabia
covers a multitude of sins.&nbsp; Besides, the Arabs easily
forget, and Mohammed is already half forgiven.&nbsp; &ldquo;Allah
yetowil omrahu,&rdquo; God grant him long life, exclaimed Radi,
after giving us these particulars.</p>
<p>The one exception I have alluded to was this.&nbsp; About two
years after Mohammed had gained the <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>Sheykhat, Bedr, the second son of
Tell&aacute;l, who had escaped the massacre of his brothers,
began to grow a beard, and in Arab opinion was come of age; and
being a youth of high spirit and high principle, resolved to
avenge his brothers&rsquo; deaths.&nbsp; This was clearly his
duty according to Arab law.&nbsp; He was alone and unaided,
except by some former slaves of his father&rsquo;s, to whose
house at Ha&iuml;l he returned secretly.&nbsp; With their
assistance, he made a plan, of falling upon Mohammed one day when
he was paying a visit to Ham&uacute;d in Ham&uacute;d&rsquo;s
house next the castle.&nbsp; He went with one slave to the house,
and asking admittance was shown into the kahwah, where, if he had
found the Emir, he would have drawn his sword and killed him;
but, as it happened, Mohammed had just gone out into the garden,
and only Ham&uacute;d was present.&nbsp; Ham&uacute;d asked him
what he wanted, and he said he wished to speak to the Emir, but
Ham&uacute;d suspecting something, detained him and gave Mohammed
warning.&nbsp; When arrested and recognised, Bedr was
cross-questioned again, and then declared his intention of
avenging his brother Bender&rsquo;s death, nor would he desist
from this.&nbsp; Mohammed, it is said, besought him to hear
reason, and offered to release him if he would be content to let
matters alone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not wish to shed more
blood,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you must promise to leave
Ha&iuml;l.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still the young man refused, and at last
in despair, Mohammed ordered his execution.&nbsp; The slave, who
accompanied, <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>Bedr, was not ill-used.&nbsp; Indeed, Mohammed sent him
away with gifts, and he now resides very comfortably at Samawa on
the Euphrates.</p>
<p>After this, Mohammed, who seems to have really felt remorse
for his wickedness, sent for Na&iuml;f, the remaining son of
Tell&aacute;l, who was still a boy, and took him to live with
him, and treated him as his own son.&nbsp; Only a year ago,
seeing the boy growing up, he exhorted him to marry, offering him
one of his nieces and a fitting establishment.&nbsp; But the boy,
they say, hung back.&nbsp; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;you would treat me as you treat a lamb or a kid which you
fatten before you kill it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mohammed wept and
entreated, and swore that he would be as a father to Na&iuml;f;
and the youth still lives honourably treated in the Emir&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; Opinion at Ha&iuml;l, however, is very decided that
as soon as Na&iuml;f is old enough, either he or his uncle must
die.&nbsp; It will be his duty to follow Bedr in his attempt, and
if need be, to end like him</p>
<p>All this, as may be supposed, was anything but agreeable
intelligence to us, as we travelled on to Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; We
felt as though we were going towards a wild beast&rsquo;s
den.&nbsp; In the meantime, however, there were four days before
us, four days of respite, and of that tranquillity which the
desert only gives, and we agreed to enjoy it to the utmost.&nbsp;
There is something in the air of Nejd, which would exhilarate
even a condemned man, and we were far from being condemned.&nbsp;
It is impossible to feel really distressed or <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>really
anxious, with such a bright sun and such pure delicious
air.&nbsp; We might feel that there was danger, but we could not
feel nervous.</p>
<p>Our last three nights in the Nef&ucirc;d were devoted to
merriment, large bonfires of yerta, round which we sat in the
clear starlight, feasting on dates bought at Jobba, and feats of
strength and games among the servants.&nbsp; I will give the
journal for one day, the 22nd of January: &ldquo;We have been
floundering along in the deep sand all day leisurely, and with
much singing and nonsense among the men, for we are in no hurry
now; it is only one day on to Igneh, the first village of Jebel
Shammar.&nbsp; The camels, though tired, are not now in any
danger of breaking down, and they have capital
<i>nass&iacute;</i> grass to eat; the tufts of grass are
beginning to get their new shoots.&nbsp; The Nef&ucirc;d here is
as big as ever, and the fuljes as deep; and we crossed the track
of a bakar wahash or wild cow, not an hour before we
stopped.&nbsp; At half past three, we came upon a shepherd
driving forty sheep to market at Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; He is a Shammar
from Ibn Rahis, a sheykh, whose tents we saw to-day a long way
off to the north-east, and he intends selling his flock to the
Persian pilgrims who are expected at Ha&iuml;l to-day.&nbsp; The
pilgrims, he says, are on their way from Mecca, and will stay a
week at Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; Who knows if we may not travel on with
them?&nbsp; The sheep, which I took at first for goats, are
gaunt, long legged creatures, with long silky hair, not wool,
growing down to their fetlocks, sleek pendulous ears <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>and smooth
faces.&nbsp; They are jet black with white heads, spots of black
round the eyes and noses, which look as if they had been drinking
ink.&nbsp; They are as unlike sheep as it is possible to
conceive, all legs, and tail, and face.&nbsp; But they have the
merit of being able to live on adr for a month at a time without
needing water.&nbsp; They are, I fancy, quite peculiar to
Nejd.&nbsp; This meeting was the signal for a halt, and behold a
delightful little fulj, just big enough to hold us, in the middle
of a bed of nass&iacute;.&nbsp; We slid our horses down the
sand-slope, the camels followed, Mohammed, the while, bargaining
with the shepherd for the fattest of his flock.&nbsp; Here we
unloaded, and the camels in another ten minutes were scattered
all over the hill-side, for there is a sand-hill at least a
hundred feet high, close by above us.&nbsp; Ibrahim, the short,
was set to watch them while the rest were busy with the
camp.&nbsp; There is an enormous supply of fire-wood, beautiful
white logs which burn like match wood.&nbsp; We climbed to the
top of the hill to take the bearings of the country, for there is
a splendid view now of Jebel Shammar, no isolated peak, as Dr.
Colvill would have it last year, but a long range of fantastic
mountains, stretching far away east and west, reminding one
somewhat of the Sierra Guadarama in Spain.&nbsp; There are also
several outlying peaks distinct from the main chain.&nbsp; Behind
us, to the north-west, the Jobba group, with continuations to the
west and south-west.&nbsp; Eastwards, there is a single point <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>Jebel
Atwa.&nbsp; Ha&iuml;l lies nearly south-east, its position marked
by an abrupt cliff near the eastern extremity of the Jebel Aja
range.&nbsp; The northern horizon only is unbroken.&nbsp; This
done, we both went down to measure a fulj half a mile off, and
found it two hundred and seventy feet deep, with hard ground
below.&nbsp; It is marked very regularly on its steep side with
sheep tracks, showing how permanent the surface of the
Nef&ucirc;d remains, for the little paths are evidently of old
date. <a name="citation203a"></a><a href="#footnote203a"
class="citation">[203a]</a>&nbsp; By the time of our return,
Hanna&rsquo;s good coffee was ready with a dish of flour and
curry, to stay hunger until the sheep is boiled.&nbsp; Awwad, who
delights in butcher&rsquo;s work, has killed the sheep in the
middle of our camp, for it is the custom to slaughter at the tent
door, and has been smearing the camels with gore.&nbsp; When
asked why, he says, &ldquo;it will look as if we had been invited
to a feast.&nbsp; It always looks well to have one&rsquo;s camels
sprinkled.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has rigged up three tent poles, as a
stand to hang the sheep from, and is dismembering in a truly
artistic fashion.&nbsp; Ibrahim el-Taw&icirc;l and Abdallah are
collecting an immense pile of wood for the night.&nbsp; Hanna is
preparing to cook.&nbsp; Poor Hanna has been having a hard time
of it since Meskakeh, for now that everybody has to walk, he
insists upon walking too, &ldquo;to prevent trouble,&rdquo; he
says, and probably he is right.&nbsp; A regular Aleppin Christian
like <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>Hanna, in such a country as this, does best by effacing
himself and disarming envy, unless indeed he can fraternize, and
at the same time inspire respect, as Ibrahim seems to have
done.&nbsp; Hanna is patient, and does not complain,
endeavouring, though with a rueful countenance, to be cheerful
when the rest tease him.&nbsp; I do my best to protect him, but
he dares not take his own part.&nbsp; Lastly, Mohammed is sitting
darning his shirt, against making his appearance at Court, and
talking to two Jobbites, who are travelling with us, about the
virtues of Ibn Rashid, and the grandeur of the Ibn
Ar&ucirc;ks.&nbsp; The Ibn Ar&ucirc;k legend, like a snowball, is
gathering as it rolls, and we fully expect Mohammed to appear in
the character of a Prince at Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; He talks already of
Nejd as his personal property, and affects a certain air of
protection towards us, as that of a host doing the honours to his
guests.&nbsp; His scare about Ibn Ermal is quite forgotten.&nbsp;
Prince or peasant, however, Mohammed has the great merit of
always being good-tempered, and this evening he is very
amusing.&nbsp; He has been telling us the whole history of his
relations with Huseyn Pasha at Deyr, which we never quite
understood before (and which I dare not repeat in detail for fear
of bringing him into trouble).&nbsp; He has been two or three
times in prison, but poor Huseyn seems to have been made a sad
fool of.&nbsp; Mohammed also gave us a full, true, and particular
account of Ahmed Beg Moali&rsquo;s death; and then we had a long
discussion about the exact <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>form in which we are to introduce
ourselves at Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; Mohammed will have it that Wilfrid
ought to represent himself as a merchant travelling to Bussorah
to recover a debt, but this we will not listen to.&nbsp; We think
it much more agreeable and quite as prudent to be
straightforward, and we intend to tell Ibn Rashid that we are
persons of distinction in search of other persons of distinction;
that we have already made acquaintance with Ibn Smeyr and Ibn
Shaalan, and all the sheykhs of the north, and that each time we
have seen a great man, we have been told that these were nothing
in point of splendour to the Emir of Ha&iuml;l, and that hearing
this, and being on our way to Bussorah, we have crossed the
Nef&ucirc;d to visit him, as in former days people went to see
Suliman ibn Daoud, and then we are to produce our presents and
wish him a long life.&nbsp; Mohammed has been obliged to admit
that this will be a better plan; and so it is settled.&nbsp;
Radi, whom we have taken more or less into our confidence, thinks
that the Emir will be pleased, and promises to sing our praises
&ldquo;below stairs,&rdquo; and he talks of a Franji having
already been at Ha&iuml;l, and having gone away with money and
clothes from Ibn Rashid.&nbsp; Who this can be, we cannot
imagine, for Mr. Palgrave was not known there as a
European.&nbsp; So we whiled away the time till dinner was ready,
and when all had well feasted, Mohammed came to invite us to the
servants&rsquo; fire, where feats of strength were going
on.&nbsp; First, <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>Abdallah lies flat on the sand, a camel saddle is put
upon his back, and then two gigantic khurjes, weighing each of
them about a hundredweight.&nbsp; With these he struggles to his
knees, and then by a prodigious effort to his feet, staggers a
pace, and topples over.&nbsp; Mohammed, not to be outdone, lifts
Ibrahim kas&iacute;r, who weighs at least twelve stone, on the
palm of his hand off his legs.&nbsp; Then they make wheels, such
as are seen at a circus, and play at a sort of leap-frog, which
consists of standing in a row one close behind the other, when
the last jumps on their shoulders and runs along till he comes to
the end, where he has to turn a somersault and alight as he can
on his head or his heels.&nbsp; This is very amusing, and in the
deep sand hurts nobody.&nbsp; All, except Hanna, join in these
athletic sports, but Awwad, who is a Bedouin born, goes through
the performance with a rather wry face.&nbsp; Bedouins never play
at games as the town Arabs do, and they have not the physical
strength of the others.&nbsp; Awwad revenges himself, however, by
malignantly hiding bits of hot coal in the ground, and every now
and then somebody steps on these traps with his bare feet, and
there is a scream.&nbsp; Great amusement, too, is caused by
Wilfrid showing them the old game of turning three times round
with the head resting on a short stick, and then trying to walk
straight.&nbsp; This is considered very funny, and they generally
manage to tumble over Hanna, and when they make him try it,
arrange that he shall run into the fire.&nbsp; The best <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>game, to my
mind, is something like one sometimes played by sailors on board
ship.&nbsp; They all put their cloaks together in one heap, and
one man has to guard it.&nbsp; Then the rest dance round him, and
try to steal the clothes away without getting touched.&nbsp;
Ibrahim taw&iacute;l is great at this sport, and defends the heap
with his huge hands and feet, dealing tremendous blows on the
unwary, and paying off, I fancy, not a few old scores.&nbsp;
Abdallah especially, who is disliked by the rest on account of
his bad temper, gets shot clean off his legs by a straight kick
almost like a football, and a fight very nearly ensues.&nbsp; But
a diversion is made by the ingenious Awwad, who steals away with
a gun and fires it suddenly from the top of the fulj, and then
comes tumbling head over heels down the sand to represent a
ghaz&uacute;.&nbsp; So the evening passes, and as we go back to
our private lair, we see for the first time the zodiacal light in
the western sky.</p>
<p>This was our last night in the Nef&ucirc;d, and the
recollection of it long stood as our standard of happiness, when
imprisoned within walls at Ha&iuml;l, or travelling in less
congenial lands.&nbsp; The next day we reached Igneh, the first
village of Jebel Shammar, and the day after the mountains
themselves, the &ldquo;Happy Mountains,&rdquo; which had so long
been the goal of our Pilgrim&rsquo;s progress.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 23.&mdash;It is like a dream to be sitting
here, writing a journal on a rock in Jebel Shammar.&nbsp; When I
remember how, years ago, I read that romantic <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>account by
Mr. Palgrave, which nobody believed, of an ideal State in the
heart of Arabia, and a happy land which nobody but he had seen,
and how impossibly remote and unreal it all appeared; and how,
later during our travels, we heard of Nejd and Ha&iuml;l and this
very Jebel Shammar, spoken of with a kind of awe by all who knew
the name, even by the Bedouins, from the day when at Aleppo Mr.
S. first answered our vague questions about it by saying,
&ldquo;It is <i>possible</i> to go there.&nbsp; Why do <i>you</i>
not go?&rdquo;&nbsp; I feel that we have achieved something which
it is not given to every one to do.&nbsp; Wilfrid declares that
he shall die happy now, even if we have our heads cut off at
Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; It is with him a favourite maxim, that every
place is exactly like every other place, but Jebel Shammar is not
like anything else, at least that I have seen in this world,
unless it be Mount Sina&iuml;, and it is more beautiful than
that.&nbsp; All our journey to-day has been a romance.&nbsp; We
passed through Igneh in the early morning, stopping only to water
our animals.&nbsp; It is a pretty little village, something like
Jobba, on the edge of the sand, but it has what Jobba has not,
square fields of green barley unwalled outside it.&nbsp; These
are of course due to irrigation, which while waiting we saw at
work from a large well, but they give it a more agricultural look
than the walled palm-groves we have hitherto seen.&nbsp;
Immediately after Igneh we came upon hard ground, and in our
delight indulged our tired mares in a fantasia, which unstiffened
their legs and did them good.&nbsp; The soil <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>was
beautifully crisp and firm, being composed of fine ground
granite, quite different from the sandstone formation of Jobba
and J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; The vegetation, too, was changed.&nbsp; The
yerta and adr and other Nef&ucirc;d plants had disappeared, and
in their place were shrubs, which I remember having seen in the
wadys of Mount Sina&iuml;, with occasionally small trees of the
acacia tribe known to pilgrims as the &ldquo;burning
bush&rdquo;&mdash;in Arabic &ldquo;talkh&rdquo;&mdash;also a
plant with thick green leaves and no stalks called
&ldquo;gheyseh,&rdquo; which they say is good for the eyes.&nbsp;
Every now and then a solitary boulder, all of red granite, rose
out of the plain, or here and there little groups of rounded
rocks, out of which we started several hares.&nbsp; The view in
front of us was beautiful beyond description, a perfectly even
plain, sloping gradually upwards, out of which these rocks and
tells cropped up like islands, and beyond it the violet-coloured
mountains now close before us, with a precipitous cliff which has
been our landmark for several days towering over all.&nbsp; The
outline of Jebel Shammar is strangely fantastic, running up into
spires and domes and pinnacles, with here and there a loop-hole
through which you can see the sky, or a wonderful boulder perched
like a rocking stone on the sky line.&nbsp; One rock was in shape
just like a camel, and would deceive any person who did not know
that a camel could not have climbed up there.&nbsp; At half-past
one we passed the first detached masses of rock which stand like
forts outside a citadel, and, bearing away gradually <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>to the
left, reached the buttresses of the main body of hills.&nbsp;
These all rise abruptly from the smooth sloping surface of the
plain, and, unlike the mountains of most countries, with no
interval of broken ground.&nbsp; Mount Sina&iuml; is the only
mountain I have seen like this.&nbsp; In both cases you can stand
on a plain, and touch the mountain with your hand.&nbsp; Only at
intervals from clefts in the hills little wadys issue, showing
that it sometimes rains in Jebel Shammar.&nbsp; Indeed to-night,
we shall probably have a proof of this, for a great black cloud
is rising behind the peaks westwards, and every now and then it
thunders.&nbsp; All is tight and secure in our tent against
rain.&nbsp; There is a small ravine in the rock close to where we
are encamped, with a deep natural tank full of the clearest
water.&nbsp; We should never have discovered it but for the
shepherd who came on with us to-day, for it is hidden away under
some gigantic granite boulders, and to get at it you have to
creep through a hole in the rock.&nbsp; A number of bright green
plants grow in among the crevices (capers?), and we have seen a
pair of partridges, little dove-coloured birds with yellow
bills.</p>
<p>We passed a small party of Bedouin Shammar, moving camp
to-day.&nbsp; One of them had a young goshawk <a
name="citation210"></a><a href="#footnote210"
class="citation">[210]</a> on his del&uacute;l.&nbsp; They had no
horses with them, and we have not crossed the track of a horse
since leaving Shakik.&nbsp; I forgot to say that yesterday we saw
a Harb Bedouin, an ugly little black <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>faced man, who told us he was
keeping sheep for the Emir.&nbsp; The Harb are the tribe which
hold the neighbourhood of Medina, and have such an evil
reputation among pilgrims.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 24.&mdash;Thunderstorm in the night.&nbsp; We
sent on Radi early this morning, for we had only a few miles to
go, with our letters to Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; It was a lovely morning
after the rain, birds singing sweetly from the bushes, but we all
felt anxious.&nbsp; Even Mohammed was silent and preoccupied, for
none knew now what any moment might bring forth.&nbsp; We put on
our best clothes, however, and tried to make our mares look
smart.&nbsp; We had expected to find Ha&iuml;l the other side of
the hills, but this was a mistake.&nbsp; Instead of crossing
them, we kept along their edge, turning gradually round to the
right, the ground still rising.&nbsp; The barometer at the camp
was 3370, and now it marks an ascent of two hundred feet.</p>
<p>We passed two villages about a mile away to our left, El Akeyt
and El Uta; and from one of them we were joined by some peasants
riding in to Ha&iuml;l on donkeys.&nbsp; This looked more like
civilisation than anything we had seen since leaving Syria.&nbsp;
We were beginning to get rather nervous about the result of our
message, when Radi appeared and announced that the Emir had read
our letters, and would be delighted to see us.&nbsp; He had
ordered two houses to be made ready for us, and nothing more
remained for us to do, than to ride into the town, and present
ourselves at the kasr.&nbsp; It was not far off, for on coming to
the <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>top
of the low ridge which had been in front of us for some time, we
suddenly saw Ha&iuml;l at our feet not half a mile distant.&nbsp;
The town is not particularly imposing, most of the houses being
hidden in palm groves, and the wall surrounding it little more
than ten feet high.&nbsp; The only important building visible,
was a large castle close to the entrance, and this Radi told us
was the kasr, Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p>In spite of preoccupations, I shall never forget the vivid
impression made on me, as we entered the town, by the
extraordinary spick and span neatness of the walls and streets,
giving almost an air of unreality.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Ha&iuml;l&mdash;The Emir Mohammed Ibn
Rashid&mdash;His menagerie&mdash;His horses&mdash;His
courtiers&mdash;His wives&mdash;Amusements of the ladies of
Ha&iuml;l&mdash;Their domestic life&mdash;An evening at the
castle&mdash;The telephone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> we stayed some time at
Ha&iuml;l, I will not give the detail of every day.&nbsp; It
would be tedious, and would involve endless repetitions, and not
a few corrections, for it was only by degrees that we learned to
understand all we saw and all we heard.</p>
<p>Our reception was everything that we could have wished.&nbsp;
As we rode into the courtyard of the kasr, we were met by some
twenty well-dressed men, each one of whom made a handsomer
appearance than any Arabs we had previously seen in our
lives.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sons of Sheykhs,&rdquo; whispered
Mohammed, who was rather pale, and evidently much impressed by
the solemnity of the occasion.&nbsp; In their midst stood a
magnificent old man, clothed in scarlet, whose tall figure and
snow-white beard gave us a notion of what Solomon might have been
in all his glory.&nbsp; He carried a long wand in his
hand&mdash;it looked like a sceptre&mdash;and came solemnly
forward to greet us.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Emir,&rdquo; whispered <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>Mohammed,
as we all alighted.&nbsp; Wilfrid then gave the usual
&ldquo;salam aleykum,&rdquo; to which every one replied
&ldquo;aleykum salam,&rdquo; in a loud cheerful tone, with a
cordiality of manner that was very reassuring.&nbsp; I thought I
had never seen so many agreeable faces collected together, or
people with so excellent a demeanour.&nbsp; The old man, smiling,
motioned to us to enter, and others led the way.&nbsp; We were
then informed that these were the servants of the Emir, and the
old man his chamberlain.&nbsp; They showed us first through a
dark tortuous entrance, constructed evidently for purposes of
defence, and then down a dark corridor, one side of which was
composed of pillars, reminding one a little of the entrance to
some ancient Egyptian temple.&nbsp; Then one of the servants
tapped at a low door, and exchanged signals with somebody else
inside, and the door was opened, and we found ourselves in a
large kahwah, or reception room.&nbsp; It was handsome from its
size, seventy feet by thirty, and from the row of five pillars,
which stood in the middle, supporting the roof.&nbsp; The columns
were about four feet in diameter, and were quite plain, with
square capitals, on which the ends of the rafters rested.&nbsp;
The room was lighted by small square air-holes near the roof, and
by the door, which was now left open.&nbsp; The whole of the
inside was white, or rather, brown-washed, and there was no
furniture of any sort, or fittings, except wooden pegs for
hanging swords to, a raised platform opposite the door where the
mortar stood for coffee-pounding, and a square hearth in one
corner, where a fire was burning.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>It
was very dark, but we could make out some slaves, busy with
coffee-pots round the fire.&nbsp; Close to this we were invited
to sit down, and then an immense number of polite speeches were
exchanged, our healths being asked after at least twenty times,
and always with some mention of the name of God, for this is
required by politeness in Nejd.&nbsp; Coffee was soon served, and
after this the conversation became general between our servants
and the servants of the Emir, and then there was a stir, and a
general rising, and the word was passed round, &ldquo;yiji el
Emir,&rdquo; the Emir is coming.&nbsp; We, too, got up, and this
time it really was the Emir.&nbsp; He came in at the head of a
group of still more smartly-dressed people than those we had seen
before, and held out his hand to Wilfrid, to me, and to Mohammed,
exchanging salutations with each of us in turn, and smiling
graciously.&nbsp; Then we all sat down, and Wilfrid made a short
speech of the sort we had already agreed upon, which the Emir
answered very amiably, saying that he was much pleased to see us,
and that he hoped we should make his house our house.&nbsp; He
then asked Mohammed for news of the road; of J&oacute;har and
Meskakeh, and especially about the war going on between Sotamm
and Ibn Smeyr.&nbsp; So far so good, and it was plain that we had
nothing now to fear; yet I could not help looking now and then at
those <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>pegs on the wall, and thinking of the story of the
young Ibn Jabars and their slaves, who had been so treacherously
murdered in this very hall, and by this very man, our host.</p>
<p>The Emir&rsquo;s face is a strange one.&nbsp; It may be mere
fancy, prompted by our knowledge of Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s past life,
but his countenance recalled to us the portraits of Richard the
Third, lean, sallow cheeks, much sunken, thin lips, with an
expression of pain, except when smiling, a thin black beard, well
defined black knitted eyebrows, and remarkable eyes,&mdash;eyes
deep sunk and piercing, like the eyes of a hawk, but ever turning
restlessly from one of our faces to the other, and then to those
beside him.&nbsp; It was the very type of a conscience-stricken
face, or of one which fears an assassin.&nbsp; His hands, too,
were long and claw-like, and never quiet for an instant,
incessantly playing, while he talked, with his beads, or with the
hem of his abba.&nbsp; With all this, the Emir is very
distinguished in appearance, with a tall figure, and, clothed as
he was in purple and fine linen, he looked every inch a
king.&nbsp; His dress was magnificent; at first we fancied it put
on only in our honour, but this we found to be a mistake, and Ibn
Rashid never wears anything less gorgeous.&nbsp; His costume
consisted of several jibbehs of brocaded Indian silk, a black
abba, interwoven with gold, and at least three kefiyehs, one over
the other, of the kind made at Bagdad.&nbsp; His aghal, also, was
of the Bagdad type, which I had hitherto <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>supposed
were only worn by women, bound up with silk and gold thread, and
set high on the forehead, so as to look like a crown.&nbsp; In
the way of arms he wore several golden-hilted daggers and a
handsome golden-hilted sword, ornamented with turquoises and
rubies, Ha&iuml;l work, as we afterwards found.&nbsp; His
immediate attendants, though less splendid, were also
magnificently clothed.</p>
<p>After about a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s conversation,
Mohammed ibn Rashid rose and went out, and we were then shown
upstairs by ourselves to a corridor, where dates and bread and
butter were served to us.&nbsp; Then a message came from the
Emir, begging that we would attend his <i>mejlis</i>, the court
of justice which he holds daily in the yard of the palace.&nbsp;
We were not at all prepared for this, and when the castle gate
was opened, and we were ushered out into the sunshine, we were
quite dazzled by the spectacle which met our eyes.</p>
<p>The courtyard, which is about a hundred yards long by fifty
broad, was completely lined with soldiers, not soldiers such as
we are accustomed to in Europe, but still soldiers.&nbsp; They
were, to a certain extent, in uniform, that is to say, they all
wore brown cloaks and blue or red kefiyehs on their heads.&nbsp;
Each, moreover, carried a silver-hilted sword.&nbsp; I counted up
to eight hundred of them forming the square, and they were
sitting in a double row under the walls, one row on a sort of
raised bench, which runs round the yard, and the <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>other
squatted on the ground in front of them.&nbsp; The Emir had a
raised seat under the main wall, and he was surrounded by his
friends, notably his cousin Ham&uacute;d, who attends him
everywhere, and his favourite slave, Mubarek, whose duty it is to
guard him constantly from assassins. <a name="citation218"></a><a
href="#footnote218" class="citation">[218]</a>&nbsp; In front of
the Emir stood half-a-dozen suppliants, and outside the square of
soldiers, a mob of citizens and pilgrims, for the pilgrimage had
arrived at Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; We had to walk across the square
escorted by a slave, and the Emir motioned us to take places at
his side, which we accordingly did; he then went on with his
work.&nbsp; People came with petitions, which were read to him by
Ham&uacute;d, and to which he generally put his seal without
discussion, and then there was a quarrel to settle, the rights of
which I confess I did not understand, for the Arabic spoken at
Ha&iuml;l is different from any we had hitherto heard.&nbsp; I
noticed, however, that though the courtiers addressed Mohammed as
Emir, the poorer people, probably Bedouins, called him &ldquo;ya
Sheykh,&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;ya Mohammed.&rdquo;&nbsp; One,
who was probably a small Shammar Sheykh, he kissed on the
cheek.&nbsp; Some pilgrims, who had a grievance, also presented
themselves, and had their case very summarily decided; they were
then turned out by the soldiers.&nbsp; No case occupied more than
three minutes, <a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>and the whole thing was over in half-an-hour.&nbsp; At
last the Emir rose, bowed to us, and went into the palace, while
we, very glad to stretch our legs, which were cramped with
squatting on the bench barely a foot wide, were escorted to our
lodgings by the chamberlain and two of the soldiers.</p>
<p>We found a double house provided for us in the main street of
Ha&iuml;l, and not two hundred yards from the kasr&mdash;a house
without pretence, but sufficient for our wants, and secure from
all intruders, for the street door could be locked, and the walls
were high.&nbsp; It consisted of two separate houses, as I
believe most dwellings in Arabia do, one for men and the other
for women.&nbsp; In the former there was a kahwah and a couple of
smaller rooms, and this we gave over to Mohammed and the
servants, keeping the <i>harim</i> for ourselves.&nbsp; This last
had a small open court, just large enough for the three mares to
stand in, an open vestibule of the sort they call <i>liwan</i> at
Damascus, and two little dens.&nbsp; In one of these dens we
stored our luggage, and in the other, spread our beds.&nbsp; The
doors of these inner rooms could be locked up when we went out,
with curious wooden locks and wooden keys; the doors were of
ithel wood.&nbsp; All was exceedingly simple, but in decent
repair and clean, the only ornaments being certain patterns,
scratched out in white from the brown wash which covered the
walls.&nbsp; Here we soon made ourselves comfortable, and were
not sorry to rest at last, after our long journey.</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>Our
rest, however, was not to come yet.&nbsp; It was only one
o&rsquo;clock when we arrived at our house, and before two, the
Emir sent for us again.&nbsp; This time the reception was a
private one in the upper rooms of the kasr, and we found the Emir
alone with Ham&uacute;d.&nbsp; He received us with even more
cordiality than before, and with less ceremony.&nbsp; We had
brought presents with us, the duty of displaying which we left to
Mohammed, who expatiated on their value and nature with all the
art of a bazaar merchant.&nbsp; As for us, we were a little
ashamed of their insignificance, for we had had no conception of
Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s true position when we left Damascus, and the
scarlet cloth jibbeh we had considered the <i>ne plus ultra</i>
of splendour for him, looked shabby among the gorgeous dresses
worn at Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; We had added to the cloak and other
clothes, which are the usual gifts of ceremony, a revolver in a
handsome embroidered case, a good telescope, and a Winchester
rifle, any one of which would have made Jedaan or Ibn Shaalan
open his eyes with pleasure; but Ibn Rashid, though far too
well-bred not to admire and approve, cared evidently little for
these things, having seen them all before.&nbsp; Even the rifle
was no novelty, for he had an exactly similar one in his
armoury.&nbsp; Poor Mohammed, however, went on quite na&iuml;vely
with his descriptions, while the Emir looked out of window
through the telescope, pretending to be examining the wall
opposite, for there was no view.&nbsp; Ham&uacute;d, his cousin,
<a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>whose
acquaintance we now made, is more <i>sympathique</i> than the
Emir, though they are ridiculously like each other in face, but
Ham&uacute;d has the advantage of a good conscience, and has no
vengeance to fear.&nbsp; They were dressed also alike, so that it
was difficult at first to know them apart; perhaps there is a
motive in this, as with the Richmonds of Shakespeare.&nbsp; The
Emir&rsquo;s room was on the same plan as the kahwah, but
smaller, and boasting only two columns, the coffee place in the
right-hand corner as you enter, and the Emir&rsquo;s fireplace,
with a fire burning in it, on an iron plate in front.&nbsp;
Persian carpets were spread, and there were plenty of cushions to
lean against by the wall.&nbsp; We were invited to sit down to
the left of the Emir and Ham&uacute;d, who never seems to leave
his side.&nbsp; Mohammed had a place on the right, between them
and the door.&nbsp; Coffee, and a very sweet tea, were handed
round in thimblefuls, and a good deal of conversation
ensued.&nbsp; We had brought a letter from our old friend the
Nawab Ikbal ed-Dowlah, who had been at Ha&iuml;l about forty
years ago, in the time of Abdallah ibn Rashid. <a
name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221"
class="citation">[221]</a>&nbsp; The Emir remembered his coming,
though he must have been a child at the time, and said some
pretty things in compliment of him.&nbsp; He then asked Mohammed
about his Ar&ucirc;k relations in J&ocirc;f, and said that they
had <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>always been faithful to him.&nbsp; They had taken the
Emir&rsquo;s part, it would seem, in some revolt which took place
there a few years ago.&nbsp; There was also an Ibn Ar&ucirc;k in
Har&iacute;k, a Bedouin sheykh, who the Emir said was a friend of
his; at least, he was on bad terms with Ibn Saoud and the
Wahhabis, and this is a title to favour at Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; Ibn
Rashid is very jealous of Ibn Saoud, and now that the Wahhabi
empire is broken up, fosters any discontent there may be in
Aared.&nbsp; I believe many of the Bedouin sheykhs of Upper Nejd
have come over to him.&nbsp; Mohammed, thus encouraged, launched
out into his favourite tales, and repeated the Ibn Ar&ucirc;k
legend, which, I confess, I am beginning to get a little tired
of, and then went on to describe the wonders of Tudmur, of which
he now implied, without exactly stating it in words, that he was
actual Sheykh.&nbsp; The house he lived in at home, he said, had
columns of marble, each sixty feet in height, and had been built
originally by Suliman ibn Daoud.&nbsp; There were two hundred of
these columns in and around it, and the walls were twenty feet
thick.&nbsp; The Emir, who seemed rather perplexed by this,
appealed to us for confirmation, and we told him that all this
really existed at Tudmur; indeed, there was no gainsaying the
fact that Mohammed&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s house had some of the
objects named on the premises, though the house itself is but a
little square box of mud.&nbsp; The city wall, in fact, makes one
side of the stable, and a column or two have been <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>worked into
the modern building; but this we did not think it necessary to
explain.&nbsp; Mohammed&rsquo;s reputation rose in consequence,
and I already began to fear that the Emir&rsquo;s civilities had
turned his head.&nbsp; I heard him whisper to Ham&uacute;d that
the silver-hilted sword he is wearing, and which is the one
Wilfrid gave him at Damascus, was an ancestral relic; it had
been, he said, &ldquo;min zeman,&rdquo; from time immemorial, in
the Ar&ucirc;k family.&nbsp; He had also established a fiction,
in which he privately entreated us to join, that we started from
home with a hawk (for all the best falcons come from Tudmur), and
lost it on the journey. <a name="citation223"></a><a
href="#footnote223" class="citation">[223]</a></p>
<p>While we were discussing these important matters, the call to
prayer was heard, and the two Ibn Rashids, begging us to remain
seated, rose and went out.</p>
<p>They were absent a few minutes, and on their return the Emir,
to our great delight, proposed to show us his gardens, and
immediately led the way down tortuous passages and through courts
and doors into a palm grove surrounded by a high wall.&nbsp; Here
we were joined by numerous slaves, some black, some white, for
there are both sorts at Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; A number of gazelles
were running about, and came up quite familiarly as we
entered.&nbsp; These were of two varieties, one browner than the
other, answering, I believe, to what are called the
&ldquo;gazelle des <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>bois,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;gazelle des plaines,&rdquo;
in Algeria.&nbsp; There were also a couple of ibexes with immense
heads, tame like the gazelles, and allowing themselves to be
stroked.&nbsp; The gazelles seemed especially at home, and we
were told that they breed here in captivity.&nbsp; The most
interesting, however, of all the animals in this garden were
three of the wild cows (bakar wahhash), from the Nef&ucirc;d,
which we had so much wished to see.&nbsp; They proved to be, as
we had supposed, a kind of antelope, <a name="citation224"></a><a
href="#footnote224" class="citation">[224]</a> though their
likeness to cows was quite close enough to account for their
name.&nbsp; They stood about as high as an Alderney calf six
months old, and had humps on their shoulders like the Indian
cattle.&nbsp; In colour they were a yellowish white, with reddish
legs turning to black towards the feet.&nbsp; The face was
parti-coloured, and the horns, which were black, were quite
straight and slanted backwards, and fully three feet long, with
spiral markings.&nbsp; These wild cows were less tame than the
rest of the animals, and the slaves were rather afraid of them,
for they seemed ready to use their horns, which were as sharp as
needles.&nbsp; The animals, though fat, evidently suffered from
confinement, for all were lame, one with an enlarged knee, and
the rest with overgrown hoofs.&nbsp; When we had seen and admired
the menagerie, and fed the antelopes with dates, we went on
through a low door, which we had almost to creep through, into
another garden, where there were <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>lemon trees (treng), bitter oranges
(h&aacute;mud), and pomegranates (roman).&nbsp; The Emir, who was
very polite and attentive to me, had some of the fruit picked and
gave me a bunch of a kind of thyme, the only flower growing
there.&nbsp; We saw some camels at work drawing water from a
large well, a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet deep, to judge
by the rope.&nbsp; The Emir then crept through another low door
and we after him, and then to our great satisfaction we found
ourselves in a stable-yard full of mares, tethered in rows each
to a manger.&nbsp; I was almost too excited to look, for it was
principally to see these that we had come so far.</p>
<p>This yard contained about twenty mares, and beyond it was
another with a nearly equal number.&nbsp; Then there was a third
with eight horses, tethered in like manner; and beyond it again a
fourth with thirty or forty foals.&nbsp; I will not now describe
all we saw, for the Emir&rsquo;s stud will require a chapter to
itself.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that Wilfrid&rsquo;s first
impression and mine were alike.&nbsp; The animals we saw before
us were not comparable for beauty of form or for quality with the
best we had seen among the Gomussa.&nbsp; The Emir, however, gave
us little time for reflection, for with a magnificent wave of his
hand, and explaining with mock humility, &ldquo;The horses of my
slaves,&rdquo; he dragged us on from one yard to another,
allowing us barely time to ask a few questions as to breed, for
the answers to which he referred us to Ham&uacute;d.&nbsp; We had
seen enough, <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>however, to make us very happy, and Ham&uacute;d had
promised that we should see them again.&nbsp; There was no doubt
whatever that, in spite of the Emir&rsquo;s disclaimer, these
were Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s celebrated mares, the representatives of
that stud of Feysul ibn Saoud, about which such a romance had
been made.</p>
<p>An equally interesting spectacle, the Emir thought for us, was
his kitchen, to which he now showed the way.&nbsp; Here, with
unconcealed pride, he displayed his pots and pans, especially
seven monstrous cauldrons, capable each, he declared, of boiling
three whole camels.&nbsp; Several of them were actually at work,
for Ibn Rashid entertains nearly two hundred guests daily,
besides his own household.&nbsp; Forty sheep or seven camels are
his daily bill of fare.&nbsp; As we came out, we found the hungry
multitude already assembling.&nbsp; Every stranger in Ha&iuml;l
has his place at Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s table, and towards sunset the
courtyard begins to fill.&nbsp; The Emir does not himself preside
at these feasts.&nbsp; He always dines alone, or in his harim;
but the slaves and attendants are extraordinarily well-drilled,
and behave with perfect civility to all comers, rich and poor
alike.&nbsp; Our own dinner was brought to us at our house.&nbsp;
Thus ended our first day at Ha&iuml;l, a day of wonderful
interest, but not a little fatiguing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ya
akhi,&rdquo; (oh my brother), said Mohammed ibn Ar&ucirc;k to
Wilfrid that evening, as they sat smoking and drinking their
coffee, &ldquo;did I not promise you that you should see Nejd,
and Ibn Rashid, and the mares <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>of Ha&iuml;l, and have you not seen
them?&rdquo;&nbsp; We both thanked him, and, indeed, we both felt
very grateful.&nbsp; Not that the favours were all on one side;
for brotherly offices had been very evenly balanced, and Mohammed
had been quite as eager to make this journey as we had.&nbsp;
But, alas! our pleasant intercourse with Mohammed was very near
its end.</p>
<p>The next few days of our life at Ha&iuml;l may be briefly
described.&nbsp; Wilfrid and Mohammed went every morning to the
mejlis, and then paid visits, sometimes to Ham&uacute;d,
sometimes to Mubarek, sometimes to the Emir.&nbsp; A slave
brought us our breakfast daily from the kasr, and a soldier came
to escort us through the streets.&nbsp; Mohammed had now made
acquaintances of his own, and was generally out all day
long.&nbsp; I stayed very much in doors, and avoided passing
through the streets, except when invited to come to the castle,
for we had agreed that discretion was the better part of valour
with us.&nbsp; That there was some reason for this prudence I
think probable, for though we never experienced anything but
politeness from the Ha&iuml;l people, we heard afterwards that
some among them were not best pleased at the reception given us
by the Emir.&nbsp; Europeans had never before been seen in Nejd;
and it is possible that a fanatical feeling might have arisen if
we had done anything to excite it.&nbsp; Wahhabism is on the
decline, but not yet extinct at Ha&iuml;l; and the Wahhabis would
of course have been our enemies.&nbsp; In the Emir&rsquo;s house,
or even under <a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>charge of one of his officers, we were perfectly safe,
but wandering about alone would have been rash.&nbsp; The object,
too, would have been insufficient, for away from the Court there
is little to see at Ha&iuml;l.</p>
<p>With Ham&uacute;d and his family we made great friends.&nbsp;
He was a man who at once inspired confidence, and we had no cause
to regret having acted on our first impression of his
character.&nbsp; He has always, they say, refused to take
presents from the Emir; and has never approved of his conduct,
though he has sided with him politically, and serves him
faithfully as a brother.&nbsp; His manners are certainly as
distinguished as can be found anywhere in the world, and he is
besides intelligent and well informed.&nbsp; The Emir is
different; with him there was always a certain
<i>g&ecirc;ne</i>.&nbsp; It was impossible to forget the horrible
story of his usurpation; and there was something, too, about him
which made it impossible to feel quite at ease in his
presence.&nbsp; Though he knows how to behave with dignity, he
does not always do so.&nbsp; It is difficult to reconcile his
almost childish manner, at times, with the ability he has given
proofs of.&nbsp; He has something of the spoiled child in his way
of wandering on from one subject to another; and, like
J&oacute;har, of asking questions which he does not always wait
to hear answered, a piece of ill-manners not altogether unroyal,
and so, perhaps, the effect of his condition as a sovereign
prince.&nbsp; He is also very na&iuml;vely <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>vain, as
most people become who are fed constantly on flattery; and he is
continually on the look-out for compliments about his power, and
his wisdom, and his possessions.&nbsp; His jealousy of other
great Sheykhs whom we have seen is often childishly
displayed.&nbsp; Ham&uacute;d has none of this.&nbsp; I fancy he
stands to his cousin Mohammed somewhat in the position in which
Morny is supposed to have stood to Louis Napoleon, only that
Morny was neither so good a man nor even so fine a gentleman as
Ham&uacute;d.&nbsp; He gives the Emir advice, and in private
speaks his mind, only appearing to the outer world as the
obsequious follower of his prince.&nbsp; Ham&uacute;d has several
sons, the eldest of whom, Majid, has all his father&rsquo;s charm
of manner, and has, besides, the attraction of perfectly candid
youth, and a quite ideal beauty.&nbsp; He is about sixteen, and
he and his brother and a young uncle came to see us the morning
after our arrival, sent by their father to pay their
compliments.&nbsp; He talked very much and openly about
everything, and gave us a quantity of information about the
various mares at the Emir&rsquo;s stable, and about his
father&rsquo;s mares and his own.&nbsp; He then went on to tell
us of an expedition he had made with the Emir to the
neighbourhood of Queyt, and of how he had seen the sea.&nbsp;
They had made a ghaz&uacute; on the fell&aacute;h&iacute;n of the
sea-coast, and had then returned.&nbsp; He asked me how I rode on
horseback, and I showed him my side-saddle, which, however, did
not surprise him.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a shedad,&rdquo; he said; <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>&ldquo;you
ride as one rides a del&uacute;l.&rdquo;&nbsp; This young Majid,
though he looks quite a boy, is married; and we were informed
that here no one of good family puts off marriage after the age
of sixteen.&nbsp; I made acquaintance with his wife Urgheyeh, who
is very pretty, very small in stature, and very young; she is one
of Metaab&rsquo;s daughters, and her sister is married to
Ham&uacute;d, so that father and son are brothers-in-law.</p>
<p>Mubarek, the Emir&rsquo;s chief slave, was one of our
particular acquaintances.&nbsp; He inhabits a very handsome
house, as houses go in Ha&iuml;l; and there Wilfrid paid him more
than one visit.&nbsp; His house is curiously decorated with
designs in plaster of birds and beasts&mdash;ostriches,
antelopes, and camels.&nbsp; Though a slave, Mubarek has not in
appearance the least trace of negro blood; and it is still a
mystery to us how he happens to be one.&nbsp; He is a well-bred
person, and has done everything in his power to make things
pleasant for us.</p>
<p>On the second day after our arrival, after the usual
compliments and some conversation, I asked the Emir&rsquo;s
permission to pay a visit to the harim.&nbsp; Mohammed ibn Rashid
appeared gratified by my request, which he immediately granted,
saying that he would send to the khawatin (ladies) to inform
them, and desire them to prepare for my reception.&nbsp; He
accordingly despatched a messenger, but we sat on talking for a
long time before anything came of the message; I had grown quite
tired of waiting, <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>and was already wondering how soon we should be at
liberty to return home, where I might write my journal in secret,
when the servant re-appeared, and brought us word that Amusheh,
the Emir&rsquo;s chief wife, was ready to receive me.&nbsp; I
fancy that ladies here seldom dress with any care unless they
want to display their silks and jewels to some visitor; and on
such special occasions their toilet is a most elaborate one, with
kohl and fresh paint, and takes a long time.&nbsp; The Emir at
once put me in charge of a black slave woman, who led the way to
the harim.&nbsp; Ham&uacute;d&rsquo;s wives as well as
Mohammed&rsquo;s live in the palace, but in separate
dwellings.&nbsp; The kasr is almost a town in itself, and I and
my black guide walked swiftly through so many alleys and courts,
and turned so many corners to the right and to the left, that if
I had been asked to find my way back unassisted, I certainly
could not have done it.&nbsp; At last, however, after crossing a
very large courtyard, we stopped at a small low door.&nbsp; This
was open, and through it I could see a number of people sitting
round a fire within, for it was the entrance to Amusheh&rsquo;s
kahwah.&nbsp; This room had two columns supporting the ceiling,
like all other rooms I had seen in the palace, except the great
kahwah, which has five.&nbsp; The fire-place, as usual, an oblong
hole in the ground, was on the left as one entered, in the corner
near the door; in it stood a brazier containing the fire, and
between it and the wall handsome carpets had been spread.&nbsp;
All the persons present <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>rose to their feet as I
arrived.&nbsp; Amusheh could easily be singled out from among the
crowd, even before she advanced to do the honours.&nbsp; She
possesses a certain distinction of appearance and manner which
would be recognised anywhere, and completely eclipsed the rest of
the company.&nbsp; But she, the daughter of Obeyd and sister of
Ham&uacute;d, has every right to outshine friends, relatives, and
fellow wives.&nbsp; Her face, though altogether less regularly
shaped than her brother&rsquo;s, is sufficiently good-looking,
with a well-cut nose and mouth, and something singularly
sparkling and brilliant.&nbsp; Hedusheh and Lulya, the two next
wives, who were present, had gold brocade as rich as hers, and
lips and cheeks smeared as red as hers with carmine, and eyes
with borders kohled as black as hers, but lacked her charm.&nbsp;
Amusheh is besides clever and amusing, and managed to keep up a
continual flow of conversation, in which the other two hardly
ventured to join.&nbsp; They sat looking pretty and agreeable,
but were evidently kept in a subordinate position.&nbsp; Lulya
shares with Amusheh, as the latter informed me, what they
consider the great privilege of never leaving town, thus taking
precedence of Hedusheh, on whom devolves the duty of following
the Emir&rsquo;s fortunes in the desert, where he always spends a
part of the year in tents.&nbsp; The obligation of such foreign
service is accounted derogatory, and accordingly objected to by
these Ha&iuml;l ladies.&nbsp; They have no idea of amusement, if
I may judge from what they said to me, <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>but a firm
conviction that perfect happiness and dignity consist in sitting
still.</p>
<p>This happiness Amusheh and I enjoyed for some time.&nbsp; We
sat together on one carpet spread over a mattress, cushions being
ranged along the wall behind us for us to lean against, and the
fire in front scorching our faces while we talked.&nbsp; On my
right sat Hedusheh; beyond her Lulya and the rest of the company,
making a circle round the fireplace.&nbsp; Before long, Atwa, a
pretty little girl, who was introduced to me as the fourth wife,
came in and took her place beyond Lulya.&nbsp; She looked more
like a future wife than one actually married, being very young;
and indeed it presently appeared that she had merely been brought
to be looked at and considered about, and that the Emir had
decided to reject her as too childish and insignificant. <a
name="citation233"></a><a href="#footnote233"
class="citation">[233]</a>&nbsp; He was, in fact, casting about
in his mind for some suitable alliance which should bring him
political support, as well as an increase of domestic
comfort.&nbsp; That these were the objects of his new matrimonial
projects I soon learned from his own mouth, from the questions he
asked me about the marriageable daughters of Bedouin
Sheyks.&nbsp; What could, indeed, be more suitable for his
purpose than some daughter of a great desert sheykh, whose family
should be valuable allies in war, while she herself, the ideal
fourth wife, unlike these ladies of the town, should be <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>always
ready to accompany her husband to the desert, and should indeed
prefer the desert to the town?</p>
<p>Among other persons present were several oldish women,
relatives, whose names and exact relationship have slipped my
memory; also a few friends and a vast number of attendants and
slaves, these last mostly black.&nbsp; They all squatted round
the fire, each trying to get into the front rank, and to seize
every opportunity of wedging in a remark, by way of joining in
the conversation of their betters.&nbsp; None of these outsiders
were otherwise than plainly dressed in the dark blue or black
cotton or woollen stuffs, used by ordinary Bedouin women in this
part of Arabia, often bordered with a very narrow red edge, like
a cord or binding, which looks well.&nbsp; The rich clothes worn
by Amusheh and her companion wives are somewhat difficult to
describe, presenting as they did an appearance of splendid
shapelessness.&nbsp; Each lady had a garment cut like an abba,
but closed up the front, so that it must have been put on over
the head; and as it was worn without any belt or fastening at the
waist, it had the effect of a sack.&nbsp; These sacks or bags
were of magnificent material, gold interwoven with silk, but
neither convenient nor becoming, effectually hiding any grace of
figure.&nbsp; Amusheh wore crimson and gold, and round her neck a
mass of gold chains studded with turquoises and pearls.&nbsp; Her
hair hung down in four long plaits, plastered smooth with some <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>reddish
stuff, and on the top of her head stuck a gold and turquoise
ornament, like a small plate, about four inches in
diameter.&nbsp; This was placed forward at the edge of the
forehead, and fastened back with gold and pearl chains to another
ornament resembling a lappet, also of gold and turquoise, hooked
on behind the head, and having flaps which fell on each side of
the head and neck, ending in long strings of pearls with
bell-shaped gold and pearl tassels.&nbsp; The pearls were all
irregularly shaped and unsorted as to size, the turquoises very
unequal in shape, size, and quality, the coral generally in
beads.&nbsp; The gold work was mostly good, some of it said to be
from Persia, but the greater part of Ha&iuml;l workmanship.&nbsp;
I had nearly forgotten to mention the nose-ring, here much larger
than I have seen it at Bagdad and elsewhere, measuring an inch
and a half to two inches across.&nbsp; It consists of a thin
circle of gold, with a knot of gold and turquoises attached by a
chain to the cap or lappet before described.&nbsp; It is worn in
the left nostril, but taken out and left dangling while the
wearer eats and drinks.&nbsp; A most inconvenient ornament, I
thought and said, and when removed it leaves an unsightly hole,
badly pierced, in the nostril, and more uncomfortable-looking
than the holes in European ears.&nbsp; But fashion rules the
ladies at Ha&iuml;l as in other places, and my new acquaintances
only laughed at such criticisms.&nbsp; They find these trinkets
useful toys, and amuse themselves while <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>talking by
continually pulling them out and putting them in again.&nbsp; The
larger size of ring seemed besides to be a mark of high position,
so that the diameter of the circle might be considered the
measure of the owner&rsquo;s rank, for the rings of all inferiors
were kept within the inch.</p>
<p>Amusheh was very communicative, but told me so many new names,
that I could not remember all the information she volunteered
about the Ibn Rashid family and relationships.&nbsp; She remarked
that neither she nor any of Mohammed&rsquo;s wives had any
children, a fact which I already knew, and not from Radi alone;
for it is the talk of the town and tribe that this is a judgment
for the Emir&rsquo;s crimes.&nbsp; She spoke with great affection
of her nephew Majid and of her brother Ham&uacute;d, and with
veneration of her father Obeyd, but I cannot recollect that she
told me anything new about any of them.&nbsp; She spoke too of
Tell&aacute;l, but of course made no mention of Bender.&nbsp;
Indeed, anxious as I was for any information she might give, I
knew too much of the family history and secrets to venture on
asking many questions; besides, any show of curiosity might have
made her suspect me of some unavowed motive.&nbsp; I therefore
felt more at ease when the conversation wandered from dangerous
topics to safe and trivial ones, such as the manners and customs
of different countries.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you not wear your
hair like mine?&rdquo; said she, holding out one of her long
auburn plaits for me to admire; and I had <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>to explain
that such short locks as mine were not sufficient for the
purpose.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then why did I not dress in gold
brocade?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How unsuitable,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;would such beautiful stuffs be for the rough work of
travelling, hunting, and riding in the desert.&rdquo;&nbsp; When
we talked of riding, Amusheh seemed for a moment doubtful whether
to be completely satisfied about her own lot in life&mdash;she
would like, she said, to see me on my mare; and I promised she
should, if possible, be gratified; but the opportunity never
occurred, and perhaps the supreme authority did not care that it
should.&nbsp; Even she might become discontented.&nbsp; Thus
conversing, time slipped away, and the midday call to prayer
sounded.&nbsp; My hostess then begged me to excuse her, and
added, &ldquo;I wish to pray.&rdquo;&nbsp; She and the rest then
got up and went to say their prayers in the middle of the
room.&nbsp; After this she returned and continued the
conversation where we had left it off.</p>
<p>Some slaves now brought a tray, which they placed before
me.&nbsp; On it was a regular solid breakfast: a large dish of
rice in the middle, set round with small bowls of various sorts
of rich and greasy sauces to be eaten with the rice.&nbsp; I
excused myself as well as I could for my want of appetite, and
said that I had this very morning eaten one of the hares sent to
us by the Emir.&nbsp; Of course I was only exhorted all the more
to eat, and obliged to go through the form of trying; but
fortunately there were other hungry mouths at hand, and eager
eyes <a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>watching till the dishes should be passed on to them,
so I got off pretty easily.</p>
<p>Amusheh afterwards invited me to go upstairs, that she might
show me her own private apartment, on the floor above the
kahwah.&nbsp; I followed her up a steep staircase, of which each
step was at least eighteen inches in height.&nbsp; It led
nowhere, except to a single room, the same size as the one below,
and built in the same way, with two columns supporting the roof,
and with a window in a recess corresponding to the door
beneath.&nbsp; This apartment was well carpeted, and contained
for other furniture a large bed, or couch, composed of a pile of
mattresses, with a velvet and gold counterpane spread over it;
also a kind of press or cupboard, a box (sanduk) rather clumsily
made of dark wood, ornamented by coarse, thin plaques of silver
stuck on it here and there.&nbsp; The press stood against the
wall, and might be five feet long and two to three feet high,
opening with two doors, and raised about two feet from the floor
on four thin legs.&nbsp; Underneath and in front of it were three
or four rows of china and crockery of a common sort, and a few
Indian bowls, all arranged on the carpet like articles for sale
in the streets.&nbsp; Amusheh asked what I thought of her house,
was it nice?&nbsp; And after satisfying herself of my
approbation, she conducted me down again, and we sat as before on
the mattress between the brazier and the wall.</p>
<p>During my stay, the Emir paid two visits to the <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>kahwah, and
each time that he appeared at the door the crowd and the wives,
except Amusheh, rose and remained standing until he left.&nbsp;
Amusheh only made a slight bow or movement, as if about to rise,
and kept her place by me while her husband stood opposite to us
talking.&nbsp; He addressed himself almost entirely to me, and
spoke chiefly in the frivolous, almost puerile, manner he
sometimes affects.&nbsp; He inquired my opinion of his wives,
whether they were more beautiful and charming than Ibn
Shaalan&rsquo;s wife, Ghiowseh, the sister of El Homeydi ibn
Meshur, or than his former wife, Turkya, Jedaan&rsquo;s daughter,
who had left him and returned to her father&rsquo;s tent.&nbsp;
In the forty-eight hours since my arrival at Ha&iuml;l, the Emir
had already asked me many questions about these two ladies, and I
now answered for the hundredth time that Turkya was pretty and
nice, and that Ghiowseh was still prettier, but very
domineering.&nbsp; He was, however, determined on a comparison of
the two families, and it was fortunate that now, having seen
Amusheh, Hedusheh, and Lulya and Atwa, I could say with truth
they were handsomer, even the poor little despised Atwa, than
their rivals.&nbsp; He was rather impatient of Atwa being classed
with the others, and said, &ldquo;Oh, Atwa, I don&rsquo;t want
her; she is worth nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; His character is, as I
have already said, a strange mixture of remarkable ability and
political insight on the one hand, and on the other a tendency to
waste time and <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>thought on the most foolish trifles, if they touch his
personal vanity.&nbsp; Of his ability I judge by his extremely
interesting remarks on serious subjects, as well as by the
position he has been able to seize and to keep.&nbsp; Of his
energy no one can doubt, for he has shown it, alas, by his
crimes; but he is so eaten up with petty personal jealousies,
that I sometimes wonder whether these would influence his conduct
at an important political crisis.&nbsp; I think, however, that at
such a moment all little vanities would be forgotten, for he is
above all things ambitious, and his vanity is, as it were, a part
and parcel of his ambition.&nbsp; He is personally jealous of all
other renowned chiefs, because here in Arabia personal heroism
is, perhaps more than anywhere else in the world since the age of
chivalry, an engine of political power.&nbsp; He would, I doubt
not, make alliance with Sotamm, if necessary to gain his ends;
nevertheless, he could not resist talking to me about Ibn Shaalan
at this most inappropriate moment, evidently hoping to hear
something disparaging of his rival.&nbsp; I confess I found it
embarrassing to undergo an examination as to the merits of
Ghiowseh and Turkya in the presence of Mohammed&rsquo;s own
wives, who all listened with wide open eyes, breathless with
attention.&nbsp; My embarrassment only increased when, after the
Emir was gone, Amusheh, on her part, immediately attacked me with
a volley of questions.&nbsp; While he remained he had persisted
in his inquiries, especially about <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>Turkya, till I, being driven into a
corner, at last lost patience, and exclaimed, &ldquo;But why do
you ask me these questions?&nbsp; Why do you want to hear about
Turkya?&nbsp; What is it to you whether she is fair or
kind?&nbsp; You never have seen her, nor is it likely you ever
will see her!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I
have never seen her.&nbsp; Yet I want to know something about
her, and to hear your opinion of her.&nbsp; Perhaps some day I
may like to marry her.&nbsp; I might take her instead of this
little girl,&rdquo; pointing to Atwa, &ldquo;who will never do
for me, and whom I will not have.&nbsp; She is worthless,&rdquo;
he repeated, &ldquo;worthless.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor little Atwa
stood listening, but I think with stolid indifference, for I
watched her countenance, and could not detect even a passing
shade of regret or disappointment.&nbsp; Indeed, of all the
wives, Amusheh alone seemed to me to have any personal feeling of
affection for the Emir.&nbsp; She, the moment he had left, fell
upon me with questions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is Turkya?&rdquo; she
asked, almost gasping for breath.&nbsp; It surprised me that she
did not know, for she knew who El-Homeydi ibn Meshur was.&nbsp; I
had to explain that his sister Ghiowseh had married Sotamm ibn
Shaalan, and to tell her the story of Sotamm&rsquo;s second
marriage; and of how Ghiowseh had determined to get rid of her
rival, and succeeded in making the latter so uncomfortable, that
she had left, and had since refused to return.&nbsp; Amusheh
certainly cares about Ibn Rashid, and I thought she feared lest a
new element of discord should be <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>brought into the family.&nbsp; As to
her own position, it could hardly be affected by the arrival of a
new wife; she, as Ham&uacute;d&rsquo;s sister, must be secure of
her rank and influence, and the Emir, with his guilty conscience,
would never dare, if he ever wished, to slight her or
Ham&uacute;d, to whose support he owes so much.</p>
<p>From Amusheh&rsquo;s house I went with a black slave girl to
another house also within the kasr, that of Ham&uacute;d&rsquo;s
wife, Beneyeh, a daughter of Metaab.&nbsp; There I saw Urgheyeh,
her sister, married to Majid, son of Ham&uacute;d; also another
wife of Ham&uacute;d&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This last person I found was
not considered as an equal, and on asking about her birth and
parentage, was told, &ldquo;She is the daughter of a
Shammar.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ahad&rdquo; (one).&nbsp; &ldquo;But <i>who</i> is
he?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ahad,&mdash;fulan min Ha&iuml;l min el
belad&rdquo; (some one, a person of the town).&nbsp; She was
hardly considered as belonging to the family.&nbsp; The third and
fourth wives, whom I afterwards saw, are, like the first,
relations, one a daughter of Tell&aacute;l, and the other of
Suleyman, Ham&uacute;d&rsquo;s uncle on the mother&rsquo;s side
(khal).&nbsp; These four are young; Majid&rsquo;s mother, whose
name I never heard, died, I believe, several years ago.&nbsp;
Ham&uacute;d, like the Emir, keeps up the number of his wives to
the exact figure permitted by the law of the Koran, any one who
dies or fails to please being replaced as we replace a
servant.</p>
<p>Beneyeh met me at her door, and we went <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>through a
little ante-room or vestibule into her kahwah.&nbsp; Here we
remained only a few moments till, to my surprise, three
arm-chairs were brought and placed in the ante-room.&nbsp; On
these I and Beneyeh and the second class wife sat, drinking tea
out of tea-cups, with saucers and tea-spoons.&nbsp; The cups were
filled to the brim, and the tea in them then filled to
overflowing with lumps of sugar.&nbsp; It was, however,
good.&nbsp; A pile of sweet limes was then brought; slaves peeled
the fruits, and divided them into quarters, which they handed
round.&nbsp; After these refreshments Beneyeh wished to show me
her room upstairs.&nbsp; It was reached, like Amusheh&rsquo;s
private apartment, by a rugged staircase from the kahwah, and was
built in the same style, with two columns supporting the rafters,
only it had no outlook, being lighted only by two small openings
high up in the wall.&nbsp; It was, however, more interesting than
Amusheh&rsquo;s room, for its walls were decorated with
arms.&nbsp; There were eighteen or twenty swords, and several
guns and daggers, arranged with some care and taste as
ornaments.&nbsp; The guns were all very old-fashioned things,
with long barrels, but most of them beautifully inlaid with
silver.&nbsp; Two of the daggers we had already seen in the
evening, when the Emir sent for them to show us as specimens of
the excellence of Ha&iuml;l goldsmiths&rsquo; work.&nbsp; The
swords, or sword-hilts, were of various degrees of richness, the
blades I did not see.&nbsp; Unfortunately at the moment I did not
think of <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>Obeyd and his three wishes, and so forgot to ask
Beneyeh whether Obeyd&rsquo;s sword was among these; it would not
have done to inquire about the widow, but there would have been
no impropriety in asking about the sword, and I afterwards the
more regretted having omitted to do so, because this proved to be
my only opportunity.&nbsp; It would have been curious to
ascertain whether Obeyd wore a plain unjewelled weapon in keeping
with Wahhabi austerity.&nbsp; He would surely have disapproved,
could he have foreseen it, of the gold and jewels, not to mention
silks and brocaded stuffs now worn by his descendants; for his
own children have none of the severe asceticism attributed to
him, although they inherit his love of prayer.</p>
<p>Ham&uacute;d came upstairs while I was there with Beneyeh, but
he only stayed a few minutes.&nbsp; They seemed to be on very
good terms, and after he left she talked a great deal about him,
and seemed very proud of him.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is
Ham&uacute;d&rsquo;s, and this, and this,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;and here is his bed,&rdquo; pointing to a pile of
mattresses with a fine coverlid.&nbsp; There were several
European articles of furniture in the room, an iron bedstead with
mattresses, several common looking-glasses, with badly gilt
frames, and a clock with weights.&nbsp; Urgheyeh now joined us,
and Beneyeh particularly showed me a handsome necklace her sister
wore of gold and coral, elaborately worked.&nbsp; &ldquo;This was
my father&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she told me, adding that the ornament
came from Persia.&nbsp; <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>Beneyeh is immensely proud of her
son, Abdallah, a fine boy of four months old.&nbsp; She and her
sister were so amiable and anxious to please, that I could
willingly have spent the rest of the afternoon with them.&nbsp;
But it was now time to pay my next visit.&nbsp; After many
good-byes and good wishes from both sisters, my black guide
seized hold of my hand, and we proceeded to the apartments of
another wife of Ham&uacute;d, Zehowa, daughter of
Tell&aacute;l.&nbsp; She is sympathetic and intelligent,
extremely small and slight, with the tiniest of hands.&nbsp; Like
the other ladies, she wore rings on her fingers, with big,
irregular turquoises.&nbsp; We sat by the fire and ate sweet
limes and trengs and drank tea.&nbsp; Zehowa sent for her
daughter, a baby only nine months old, to show me, and I told her
I had a daughter of my own, and that girls were better than boys,
which pleased her, and she answered, &ldquo;Yes, the daughter is
the mother&rsquo;s, but the son belongs to the father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently one of the guards, a tall black fellow, all in
scarlet, came with a message for me, a request from the Beg that
I would join him in the Emir&rsquo;s kahwah, where he was waiting
for me.&nbsp; Zehowa, like her cousins, begged hard that I would
stay, or at least promise to visit her again as soon as possible,
and I, bidding her farewell, followed the scarlet and black
swordsman through courts, alleys, and passages to the kahwah,
where I found Wilfrid.&nbsp; He was being entertained by an
elderly man with coffee and conversation.&nbsp; This personage
was Mubarek, <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>already mentioned as the chief of the slaves, and he
had been giving Wilfrid a vast deal of interesting information
about horses, especially the dispersion of Feysul ibn
Saoud&rsquo;s stud, and the chief sources from which that
celebrated collection was obtained.&nbsp; It had been originally
got together, he said, entirely from the Bedouins, both of Nejd
and of the north, by purchase and in war.</p>
<p>I never saw Zehowa, Beneyeh, or Amusheh again, for the next
few days were fully occupied, and afterwards, owing to our
finding ourselves involved in a network of mystery, and subject
to an adverse influence, the pressure of which made itself felt
without our being able at first to lay hold of anything tangible,
or even to conjecture the cause, it became more than ever an
object to us to remain quiet and unobserved.&nbsp; But I am
anticipating circumstances to be detailed further on.</p>
<p>About three days later I paid a visit to the harim of
Ham&uacute;d&rsquo;s uncle.&nbsp; This gentleman, Suleyman, we
were already acquainted with, from seeing him at Court on several
occasions.&nbsp; He had sent me an invitation to visit his
family, and two black slaves came to escort me to their house,
one of the dependencies of the palace.&nbsp; In a kahwah opening
out of a small yard, I found the old man waiting to receive
me.&nbsp; He dyes his beard red, and loves books, amidst a pile
of which he was sitting.&nbsp; I was in hopes that his
conversation would be instructive, and we had just begun to talk
when, <a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>alas, his wife came in with a rush, followed by a crowd
of other women, upon which he hastily gathered up all his books
and some manuscripts which were lying about, and putting some of
them away in a cupboard, carried off the rest and made his
escape.</p>
<p>Ghut, his wife, was the stupidest person I had seen at
Ha&iuml;l, but very talkative, and hospitable with dates, fresh
butter floating in its own buttermilk, and sugar-plums.&nbsp; The
many-coloured crowd of white, brown, and black attendants,
slaves, and children, were not in much awe of her, and chattered
away without a check to their hearts&rsquo; content.&nbsp; All
were, however, respectful and attentive to me.&nbsp; Ghut&rsquo;s
daughter, another Zehowa, presently arrived with a slave carrying
her son, Abderrahman, a child about a year old.&nbsp; This Zehowa
was good-looking, but nearly as stupid and tiresome as her
mother.&nbsp; She was very much taken up with showing me her box
of trinkets, which she sent for on purpose to display before me
its contents.&nbsp; These were of the usual sort, gold ornaments
for head and arms and ankles, set with turquoises and strings of
pearls.&nbsp; The furniture of the room, which she and her mother
specially pointed out for my admiration, was also like what I had
already seen&mdash;presses or boxes on legs, and ornamented with
rude silver plaques.</p>
<p>The conversation was dull.&nbsp; Here is a sample:</p>
<p class="gutindent"><span class="smcap"><i>I</i></span><span
class="smcap">.&nbsp; &ldquo;</span>What do you do all day
long<span class="smcap">?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Zeh.</i><span class="smcap">&nbsp;
&ldquo;</span>We live in the kasr<span

<p class="gutindent"><i>I</i>.<span class="smcap">&nbsp;
&ldquo;</span>Don&rsquo;t you go out at all<span
class="smcap">?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="gutindent"><a name="page248"></a><span

class="smcap">&nbsp; &ldquo;</span>No<span class="smcap">;
</span>we always stay in the kasr<span
class="smcap">.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>I</i>.<span class="smcap">&nbsp;
&ldquo;</span>Then you never ride as we do<span
class="smcap">?&rdquo;&nbsp; (</span>I always ask if they ride,
to see the effect<span class="smcap">.)</span></p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Zeh.</i><span class="smcap">&nbsp;
&ldquo;</span>No, we have no mares to ride<span
class="smcap">.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>I</i>.<span class="smcap">&nbsp;
&ldquo;</span>What a pity! and don&rsquo;t you ever go into the
country outside Ha&iuml;l, the desert<span
class="smcap">?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Zeh.</i><span class="smcap">&nbsp;
&ldquo;</span>Oh, no, of course not<span
class="smcap">.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>I</i>.<span class="smcap">&nbsp;
&ldquo;</span>But, to pass the time, what do you do<span
class="smcap">?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Zeh.</i><span class="smcap">&nbsp;
&ldquo;</span>We do nothing<span
class="smcap">.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Here a sharp black boy interrupted us, &ldquo;O,
khat&uacute;n, these are daughters of sheykhs, they have no
work&mdash;no work <i>at all</i> to do, don&rsquo;t you
understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>I</i>.<span class="smcap">&nbsp;
&ldquo;</span>Of course, I understand perfectly<span
class="smcap">; </span>but they might amuse themselves without
doing work<span class="smcap">,&rdquo; </span>and turning to
Zehowa I added<span class="smcap">, &ldquo;</span>Don&rsquo;t you
even look at the horses<span class="smcap">?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Zeh.</i><span class="smcap">&nbsp;
&ldquo;</span>No, we do nothing<span
class="smcap">.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>I</i>.<span class="smcap">&nbsp;
&ldquo;</span>I should die if I did nothing<span
class="smcap">.&nbsp; </span>When I am at home I always walk
round the first thing in the morning to look at my horses<span
class="smcap">.&nbsp; </span>How do you manage to spend your
lives<span class="smcap">?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Zeh.</i><span class="smcap">&nbsp;
&ldquo;</span>We sit<span class="smcap">.&rdquo;&nbsp;
</span>Thus supreme contentment in the harim here is to sit in
absolute idleness<span class="smcap">.&nbsp; </span>It seems odd,
where the men are so active and adventurous, that the women
should be satisfied to be bored<span class="smcap">; </span>but
such, I suppose, is the tyranny of fashion<span
class="smcap">.</span></p>
<p>Every evening after dinner we used to receive a message from
the Emir, inviting us to spend the evening with him.&nbsp; This
was always the pleasantest part of the day, for we generally
found one or two interesting visitors sitting with him.&nbsp; As
a sample of these I give an extract from my journal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found the Emir this evening in high good <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>humour.&nbsp; News had just come from El-Homeydi ibn
Meshur, a Roala sheykh of the faction opposed to Sotamm, that a
battle was fought about a month ago between the Roala and the
Welled Ali, and that Sotamm has been worsted.&nbsp; Sotamm, at
the head of a ghaz&uacute; numbering six hundred horsemen, had
marched against Ibn Smeyr at Jerud, but the latter refused to
come out and fight him, and so Sotamm retired.&nbsp; On his way
back home, however, he fell in with an outlying camp of Welled
Ali, somewhere to the east of the Hauran, and summoned it to
surrender.&nbsp; These, numbering only a hundred and fifty
horsemen, at first entered into negotiation, and, it is said,
offered to give up their camp and camels if they were permitted
to retire with their mares (the women and children would of
course not have been molested in any case), and to this Sotamm
wished to agree.&nbsp; But the younger men of his party, and
especially the Ibn Jendal family, who had a death to avenge,
would not hear of compromise, and a battle ensued.&nbsp; It
ended, strangely enough, in favour of the weaker side, who
succeeded in killing four of the Roala, and among them Tellal ibn
Shaalan, Sotamm&rsquo;s cousin and heir presumptive.&nbsp; Sotamm
himself is said to have been saved only by the speed of his
mare.&nbsp; Though the forces engaged were so disproportionate,
nobody here seems surprised at the result, for victory and defeat
are &ldquo;min Allah,&rdquo; &ldquo;in the hand of God;&rdquo;
but everybody is highly delighted, and the Emir can hardly
contain <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>himself for joy.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you think now of
Sotamm?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;has he head, or has he no
head?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not much, I am afraid,&rdquo; I
answered, &ldquo;but I am sorry for him.&nbsp; He is weak, and
does not know how to manage his people, but he has a good
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And Ibn Smeyr, what do you say to Ibn
Smeyr?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He has more head than heart,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; This delighted the Emir.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;it is you, khat&uacute;n, that have the
head.&nbsp; Now what do you say to me? have I head, or not
head?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have head,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And Ham&uacute;d?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You all of you have
plenty of head here, more of course than the Bedouins, who are
most of them like children.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But we are
Bedouins too,&rdquo; he said, hoping to be contradicted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I like the Bedouins best,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;it is
better to have heart than head.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he went on to
cross-question me about all the other sheykhs whose names he
knew.&nbsp; &ldquo;Which,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;is the best of
all you have met with?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mohammed Dukhi,&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;is the cleverest, Ferhan ibn Hedeb the
best-mannered, but the one I like best is your relation in the
Jezireh, Faris Jerba.&rdquo;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think he was
quite pleased at this.&nbsp; He had never heard, he said, good or
bad of Ibn Hedeb, who belonged to the Bisshr.&nbsp; He was not on
terms with any of the Bisshr except Meshur ibn Mershid, who had
paid him a visit two years ago.&nbsp; We told him that both
Meshur and Faris were Wilfrid&rsquo;s
&ldquo;brothers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Meshur he liked, but Faris Jerba
was evidently no favourite of his.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>I
fancy the Emir has taken Ferhan&rsquo;s part in the family
quarrel.&nbsp; It is certain that when Amsheh, Sfuk&rsquo;s widow
and Abdul Kerim&rsquo;s mother, came with her son Faris to Nejd,
he would see neither of them.&nbsp; They stayed in the desert all
the time they were here, and never came to Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp;
Rashid ibn Ali, too, is Faris&rsquo;s friend, and of course in no
favour at this court. <a name="citation251"></a><a
href="#footnote251" class="citation">[251]</a>&nbsp; He then
asked about Jedaan, touched rather unfeelingly on the idiocy of
Turki, Jedaan&rsquo;s only son, and then cut some jokes at the
expense of our old acquaintance, Smeyr ibn Zeydan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;An old fool,&rdquo; the Emir exclaimed, &ldquo;why did
they send him here?&nbsp; They might as well have sent a
camel!&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the Smeyr who came to Nejd a year and
a half ago to try and get Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s assistance for
Sotamm, and arrange a coalition against Jedaan and the
Sebaa.&nbsp; We knew his mission had failed, but the fact is Ibn
Rashid is eaten up with jealousy of anyone who has the least
reputation in the desert.&nbsp; We are surprised, however, to
find him so well informed about everything and everybody in the
far north, and we are much interested, as he has solved for us
one of the problems about Nejd which used to puzzle us, namely,
the relations maintained by the tribes of Jebel Shammar with
those of the north.&nbsp; The Emir has told us that the Shammar
of the Jezireh and his own Shammar still count each other as near
relations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our <a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>horses,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are
of the same blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; With the Roala he has made peace,
and with Ibn Haddal; but the Sebaa and the rest of the Bisshr
clan are out of his way.&nbsp; They never come anywhere near
Nejd, except on ghaz&uacute;s, and that very rarely.&nbsp; Once,
however, a ghaz&uacute;, of Fedaan, had got as far as
Kas&iacute;m, and he had gone out against them, and captured a
Seglawi Jedran mare of the Ibn Sbeni strain.&nbsp; He promised to
show it to us.&nbsp; We then talked a good deal about horses, and
our knowledge on this head caused general astonishment.&nbsp;
Indeed, I think we could pass a better examination in the breeds
than most of the Ibn Rashids.&nbsp; By long residence in town
they have lost many of the Bedouin traditions.&nbsp;
Ham&uacute;d, however, who takes more interest in horses than the
Emir, has told us a number of interesting facts relating to the
stud here, and that of the late Emir of Riad, Feysul ibn Saoud,
solving another problem, that of the fabulous Nejd breed; but we
are taking separate notes about these things.</p>
<p>We had not been talking long with the Emir and Ham&uacute;d,
when a fat vulgar-looking fellow was introduced and made to sit
down by us.&nbsp; It was evident that he was no Ha&iuml;l man,
for his features were coarse, and his manners rude.&nbsp; He
talked with a strong Bagdadi accent, and was addressed by
everyone as &ldquo;ya Hajji.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was clear that he
belonged to the Haj, but why was he here?&nbsp; The mystery was
soon cleared up, for after a whispered <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>conversation with Ham&uacute;d, the new visitor turned
to Wilfrid, and began addressing him in what we at first took to
be gibberish, until seeing that we made no answer, he exclaimed
in Arabic, &ldquo;There, I told you he was no
Englishman!&rdquo;&nbsp; Wilfrid then cross-questioned him, and
elicited the fact that he had been a stoker on board one of the
British India Company&rsquo;s steamers on the Persian Gulf, and
that the language he had been talking was English.&nbsp; Only two
phrases, however, we succeeded in distinguishing, &ldquo;werry
good,&rdquo; and &ldquo;chief engineer&rdquo;&mdash;and having
recognised them and given their Arabic equivalents, our identity
was admitted.&nbsp; The fellow was then sent about his business,
and a very small, very polite old man took his place.&nbsp; He
was conspicuous among these well-dressed Shammar by the plainest
possible dress, a dark brown abba without hem or ornament, and a
cotton kefiyeh on his head, unbound by any aghal
whatsoever.&nbsp; He was treated with great respect, however, by
all, and it was easy to see that he was a man of condition.&nbsp;
He entered freely into conversation with us, and talked to
Mohammed about his relations in Aared, and it presently appeared
that he was from Southern Nejd.&nbsp; This fact explained the
severity of his costume, for among the Wahhabis, no silk or gold
ornaments are tolerated.&nbsp; He was, in fact, the Sheykh of
Har&iacute;k, the last town of Nejd towards the south, and close
to the Dahna, or great southern desert.&nbsp; This he described
to us as exactly like the <a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>Nef&ucirc;d we have just crossed,
only with more vegetation.&nbsp; The ghada is the principal wood,
but there are palms in places.</p>
<p>It is not the custom of Ha&iuml;l to smoke, either from
Wahhabi prejudice, or, as I am more inclined to think, because
tobacco has never penetrated so far inland in quantities
sufficient to make the habit general.&nbsp; No objection,
however, has been made to Wilfrid&rsquo;s pipe, which he smokes
when and where he chooses, and this evening when the call to
prayer sounded, and the Emir and Ham&uacute;d had gone out to
perform their devotions, the old man I have just mentioned, Nassr
ibn Hezani, hinted without more ceremony that he should like a
whiff.&nbsp; He has quarrelled with Ibn Saoud, and probably hates
all the Wahhabi practices, and was very glad to take the
opportunity of committing this act of wickedness.&nbsp; He was
careful, however, to return the pipe before the rest came
back.&nbsp; He, at any rate, if a Wahhabi, is not one of the
disagreeable sort described by Mr. Palgrave, for he invited us
very cordially to go back home with him to Har&iacute;k.&nbsp;
The Emir, however, made rather a face at this suggestion, and
gave such an alarming account of what would happen to us if we
went to Riad, that I don&rsquo;t think it would be wise to
attempt to go there now.&nbsp; We could not go in fact without
the Emir&rsquo;s permission.&nbsp; I do not much care, for town
life is wearisome; we have had enough of it, and I have not much
curiosity to see more of Nejd, unless we can go <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>among the
Bedouins there.&nbsp; If Ibn Saoud still had his collection of
mares the sight of them would be worth some risk, but his stud
has long since been scattered, and Nassr ibn Hezani assures us
that there is nothing now in Arabia to compare with Ibn
Rashid&rsquo;s stud.&nbsp; Ibn Hezani, like everybody else,
laughs at the story of a Nejd breed, and says, as everybody else
does, that the mares at Riad were a collection made by Feysul ibn
Saoud in quite recent times.</p>
<p>Later in the evening, a native goldsmith was introduced, with
a number of articles worked by him at Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; They were
pretty, but not specially interesting, or very unlike what may be
seen elsewhere, dagger hilts and sheaths, and a few
ornaments.&nbsp; It was this man, however, who had made the gold
hilts which all the princely family here wear to their
swords.&nbsp; These we examined, and found the work really
good.</p>
<p>The most amusing incident of the evening, however, and one
which we were not at all prepared for, was the sudden production
by the Emir of one of those toys called telephones, which were
the fashion last year in Europe.&nbsp; This the Emir caused two
of his slaves to perform with, one going into the courtyard
outside, and the other listening.&nbsp; The message was
successfully delivered, the slave outside, to make things doubly
sure, shouting at the top of his voice, &ldquo;Ya Abdallah weyn
ente? yeridak el Emir.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O Abdallah, where are
you? the Emir wants you,&rdquo; and other such phrases.&nbsp; We
<a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>expressed great surprise, as in duty bound; indeed, it
was the first time we had actually seen the toy, and it is
singular to find so very modern an invention already at
Ha&iuml;l.</p>
<p>At about ten o&rsquo;clock, the Emir began to yawn, and we all
got up and wished him good-night.&nbsp; He very kindly sent for,
and gave me, a number of trengs and oranges, which he gave orders
should be conveyed to our house, together with a new-laid
ostrich&rsquo;s egg, the &ldquo;first of the season,&rdquo; which
had just been brought to him from the Nef&ucirc;d.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Political and historical&mdash;Shepherd role
in Arabia&mdash;An hereditary policy&mdash;The army&mdash;The
law&mdash;Taxation&mdash;The finances of Jebel Shammar&mdash;Ibn
Rashid&rsquo;s ambition.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following is the result of our
inquiries made while at Ha&iuml;l into the political condition
and resources of the country.&nbsp; It has no pretension to rigid
accuracy, especially in the figures given, but it will serve to
convey an idea of the kind of government found in Arabia, and of
the capacity for self-rule of the Arab race.</p>
<p>The political constitution of Jebel Shammar is exceedingly
curious; not only is it unlike anything we are accustomed to in
Europe, but it is probably unique, even in Asia.&nbsp; It would
seem, in fact, to represent some ancient form of government
indigenous to the country, and to have sprung naturally from the
physical necessities of the land, and the character of its
inhabitants.&nbsp; I look upon Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s government as
in all likelihood identical with that of the Kings of Arabia, who
came to visit Solomon, and of the Shepherd Kings <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>who, at a
still earlier date, held Egypt and Babylonia; and I have little
doubt that it owes its success to the fact of its being thus in
harmony with Arab ideas and Arab tradition.&nbsp; To understand
it rightly, one ought to consider what Arabia is, and what the
Arab character and mode of life.&nbsp; The whole of the
peninsula, with the exception, perhaps, of Yemen, and certain
districts of Hadramaut within the influence of the monsoon winds,
is a rainless, waterless region, in every sense of the word a
desert.&nbsp; The soil is a poor one, mainly of gravel or of
sand, and except in a few favoured spots, unsuited for
cultivation; indeed, no cultivation is possible at all in Nejd,
except with the help of irrigation, and, as there is no water
above ground, of irrigation from wells.&nbsp; Even wells are
rare.&nbsp; The general character of the central plateaux, and of
the peninsula, is that of vast uplands of gravel, as nearly
destitute of vegetation as any in the world, and incapable of
retaining water, even at a great depth.&nbsp; It is only in
certain depressions of the plain, several hundred feet lower than
the general level, that wells as a rule are found, and wherever
these occur with a sufficient supply of water, towns and villages
with gardens round them, have sprung up.&nbsp; These, however,
are often widely apart, showing as mere spots on the map of
Arabia, and unconnected with each other by any intervening
district of agricultural land.&nbsp; Indeed, it is not too much
to say, that Nejd contains no agricultural region, as <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>we
understand agriculture, and that all its production is garden
produce.&nbsp; From this state of things, it happens that there
is also no rural class, and that each town is isolated from its
neighbours to a degree impossible with us.&nbsp; The desert
surrounds them like a sea, and they have no point of contact one
with the other in the shape of intervening fields or villages, or
even intervening pastures.&nbsp; They are isolated in the most
literal sense, and from this fact has sprung the political
individuality it has always been their care to maintain.&nbsp;
Each city is an independent state.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the desert outside, though untenanted by any settled
population, is roamed over by the Bedouin tribes, who form the
bulk of the Arab race.&nbsp; These occupy for the most part the
Nef&ucirc;ds, where alone pasture in any abundance is found; but
they frequent also every part of the upland districts, and being
both more warlike and more numerous than the townsmen, hold every
road leading from town to town, so that it depends upon their
good will and pleasure, to cut off communication for the citizens
entirely from the world.</p>
<p>The towns, as I have said, are for the most part
self-supporting; but their production is limited to garden
produce, and the date.&nbsp; They grow no wheat and rear no
stock, so that for bread and meat they are dependent on
without.&nbsp; They require also a market for their industries,
the weaving of cloth, the manufacture of arms and <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>utensils,
and it is necessary, at least in Jebel Shammar, to send yearly
caravans to the Euphrates for corn.&nbsp; Thus security of
travelling outside their walls is essential to the life of every
town in Arabia, and on this necessity the whole political
structure of their government is built.&nbsp; The towns put
themselves each under the protection of the principal Bedouin
Sheykh of its district, who, on the consideration of a yearly
tribute, guarantees the citizens&rsquo; safety outside the city
walls, enabling them to travel unmolested as far as his
jurisdiction extends, and this, in the case of a powerful tribe,
may be many hundred miles, and embrace many cities.&nbsp; The
towns are then said to &ldquo;belong&rdquo; to such and such a
tribe, and the Bedouin Sheykh becomes their suzerain, or Lord
Protector, until, from their common vassalage, and the freedom of
intercourse it secures them with each other, the germs of
federation spring up, and develop sometimes into nationality.</p>
<p>This has, I believe, been always the condition of Arabia.</p>
<p>A farther development then ensues.&nbsp; The Bedouin Sheykh,
grown rich with the tribute of a score of towns, builds himself a
castle close to one of them, and lives there during the summer
months.&nbsp; Then with the prestige of his rank (for Bedouin
blood is still accounted the purest), and backed by his power in
the desert, he speedily becomes the practical ruler of the town,
and from protector of the citizens <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>becomes their sovereign.&nbsp; He is
now dignified by them with the title of Emir or prince, and
though still their Sheykh to the Bedouins, becomes king of all
the towns which pay him tribute.</p>
<p>This form of government, resting as it does on a natural
basis, has always been reverted to in Arabia, whenever the
country has, after an interval of foreign or domestic tyranny,
succeeded in emancipating itself.&nbsp; Of very early Arabia
little is known; neither the Persian nor the Macedonian nor the
Roman Empires embraced it, and it is probable that Nejd at least
existed till the time of Mahomet exclusively under the system of
government I have described.&nbsp; Then for a short time it
became part of the Mussulman Empire, and shared in the
centralised or semi-centralised administration of the Caliphs,
which substituted a theocratic rule for the simpler forms
preceding it.&nbsp; But though the birthplace of Islam, no part
of the Arabian Empire was sooner in revolt than Arabia
itself.&nbsp; In the second century of the Mahometan era, nearly
all the peninsula had reverted to its ancient independence, nor,
except temporarily, has Nejd itself ever been since included in
the imperial system of a foreign king or potentate.&nbsp; In the
middle of last century, however, just as Mahomet had asserted his
spiritual authority over the peninsula, the Wahhabi Emir of Aared
once more established a centralized and theocratic government in
Arabia.&nbsp; The Bedouin Princes were one after another
dispossessed, and <a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>a new Arabian Empire was established.&nbsp; This
included not only the whole of Nejd, but at one time Yemen,
Hejaz, and Hasa, with the northern desert as far north as the
latitude of Damascus.&nbsp; For nearly sixty years the
independence of the towns and tribes of the interior was crushed,
and a system of imperial rule substituted for that of old
Arabia.&nbsp; The Ibn Saouds, &ldquo;Im&acirc;ms of Nejd,&rdquo;
governed neither more nor less than had the first Caliphs, and
with the same divine pretensions.&nbsp; But their rule came to an
end in 1818, when Nejd was conquered by the Turks, and the
reigning Ibn Saoud made prisoner and beheaded at
Constantinople.&nbsp; Then, on the retirement of the Turks, (for
they were unable long to retain their conquest,) shepherd
government again asserted itself, and the principality of Jebel
Shammar was founded.</p>
<p>The Shammar tribe is the most powerful of Northern Nejd, and
the towns of Ha&iuml;l, Kefar, Bekaa, and the rest, put
themselves under the protection of Abdallah ibn Rashid, who had
succeeded in gaining the Shammar Sheykhat for himself.&nbsp; He
seems to have been a man of great ability, and to him is due the
policy of rule which his descendants have ever since
pursued.&nbsp; He took up his residence in Ha&iuml;l, and built
the castle there, and caused himself to be recognized as Emir,
first in vassalage to the Ibn Saouds, who had reappeared in
Aared, but later on his own account.&nbsp; His policy seems to
have been first to conciliate or subdue the <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>other
Bedouin tribes of Nejd, forcing them to become tributary to his
own tribe, the Shammar, and secondly to establish his
protectorate over all the northern towns.&nbsp; This was a simple
plan enough, and one which any Bedouin Sheykh might have devised;
but Abdallah&rsquo;s merit consists in the method of its
application.&nbsp; He saw that in order to gain his object, he
must appeal to national ideas and national prejudices.&nbsp; The
tribute which he extracted from the towns, he spent liberally in
the desert, exercising boundless hospitality to every sheykh who
might chance to visit him.&nbsp; To all he gave presents, and
dazzled them with his magnificence, sending them back to the
tribes impressed with his wealth and power.&nbsp; Thus he made
numerous friends, with whose aid he was able to coerce the rest,
his enemies or rivals.&nbsp; In treating with these he seems
always to have tried conciliation first, and, if forced to arms,
to have been satisfied with a single victory, making friends at
once with the vanquished, and even restoring to them their
property, an act of generosity which met full appreciation in the
desert.&nbsp; By this means his power and reputation increased
rapidly, as did that of his brother and right-hand man Obeyd, who
is now a legendary hero in Nejd.</p>
<p>Another matter to which the founder of the Ibn Rashid dynasty
paid much attention was finance.&nbsp; Though spending large sums
yearly on presents and entertainments, he took care that these
should not <a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>exceed his revenue, and at his death he left, according
to common report, a house full of silver pieces to his son.&nbsp;
Nor have any of his successors been otherwise than thrifty.&nbsp;
It is impossible of course to guess the precise amount of
treasure thus saved, but that it represents a fabulous fortune in
Arabia is certain; the possession of this, with the prestige
which in a poor country wealth gives, is an immense source of
power.</p>
<p>Lastly Abdallah, and all the Ibn Rashid family, have been
endowed with a large share of caution.&nbsp; No important
enterprise has been embarked on in a hurry; and certainly at the
present day affairs of state are discussed in family council,
before any action is taken.&nbsp; It seems to have been always a
rule with the Ibn Rashids to think twice, thrice, or a dozen
times before acting, for even Mohammed&rsquo;s violent deeds
towards his nephews were premeditated, and thought over for many
months beforehand.&nbsp; In their conduct with the Ibn Saouds and
the Turkish Sultans, they have always waited their opportunity,
and avoided an open rupture.&nbsp; It is very remarkable that so
many members of this family should be superior men, for it is
difficult to say who has been the ablest man of them, Abdallah,
Obeyd, Tell&aacute;l, Mohammed, or his cousin Ham&uacute;d.&nbsp;
Nor is the rising generation less promising.</p>
<p>Having united into a sort of confederation all the Bedouin
tribes of Northern Nejd, Abdallah became naturally supreme over
the towns; but he was not <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>satisfied merely with power, he
aimed at making his rule popular.&nbsp; It is much to his credit,
and to that of his successors, that none of them seem to have
abused their position.&nbsp; Liberality and conciliation,
combined with an occasional display of power, have been no less
their policy with the townsmen than with the Bedouins, and they
have thus placed their rule on its only secure basis,
popularity.&nbsp; In early days the Ibn Rashids had to fight for
their position at Ha&iuml;l, and later in J&ocirc;f and at
Meskakeh.&nbsp; But their rule is now acknowledged freely
everywhere, enthusiastically in Jebel Shammar.&nbsp; It strikes a
traveller fresh from Turkey as surpassingly strange to hear the
comments passed by the townspeople of Ha&iuml;l on their
government, for it is impossible to converse ten minutes with any
one of them without being assured that the government of the Emir
is the best government in the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;El hamdu
lillah, ours is a fortunate country.&nbsp; It is not with us as
with the Turks and Persians, whose government is no
government.&nbsp; Here we are happy and prosperous.&nbsp; El
hamdu lillah.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have often been amused at this
chauvinism.</p>
<p>In the town of Ha&iuml;l the Emir lives in state, having a
body-guard of 800 or 1000 men dressed in a kind of uniform, that
is to say, in brown cloaks and red or blue kefiyehs, and armed
with silver-hilted swords.&nbsp; These are recruited from among
the young men of the towns and villages by voluntary enlistment,
those who wish to serve inscribing their <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>names at
the castle, and being called out as occasion requires.&nbsp;
Their duties are light, and they live most of them with their
families, receiving neither pay nor rations, except when employed
away from home on garrison duty in outlying forts and at
J&ocirc;f.&nbsp; Their expense, therefore, to the Emir is little
more than that of their clothes and arms.&nbsp; To them is
entrusted any police work that may be necessary in the towns, but
it is very seldom that the authority of the Emir requires other
support than that of public opinion.&nbsp; The Arabs of Nejd are
a singularly temperate race, and hardly ever indulge in brawling
or breaches of the peace.&nbsp; If disputes arise between
citizens they are almost always settled on the spot by the
interference of neighbours; and the rowdyism and violence of
European towns are unknown at Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; Where, however,
quarrels are not to be settled by the intervention of friends,
the disputants bring their cases to the Emir, who settles them in
open court, the <i>mejlis</i>, and whose word is final.&nbsp; The
law of the Koran, though often referred to, is not, I fancy, the
main rule of the Emir&rsquo;s decision, but rather Arabian
custom, an authority far older than the Mussulman code.&nbsp; I
doubt if it is often necessary for the soldiers to support such
decisions by force.&nbsp; Thieving, I have been repeatedly
assured, is almost unknown at Ha&iuml;l; but robbers or thieves
taken redhanded, lose for the first offence a hand, for the
second their head.</p>
<p>In the desert, and everywhere outside the precincts <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>of the
town, order is kept by the Bedouins, with whom the Emir lives a
portion of each year.&nbsp; He is then neither more nor less
himself than a Bedouin, throws off his shoes and town finery,
arms himself with a lance, and leads a wandering life in the
Nef&ucirc;d.&nbsp; He commonly does this at the commencement of
spring, and spring is the season of his wars.&nbsp; Then with the
extreme heat of summer he returns to Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; The tribute
paid by each town and village to the Emir is assessed according
to its wealth in date palms, and the sheep kept by its citizens
with the Bedouins.&nbsp; Four khrush for each tree is, I believe,
the amount, trees under seven years old being exempt.&nbsp; At
Ha&iuml;l this is levied by the Emir&rsquo;s officers, but
elsewhere by the local sheykhs, who are responsible for its due
collection.&nbsp; At J&ocirc;f and Meskakeh, which are still in
the position of territory newly annexed, Ibn Rashid is
represented by a vakil, or lieutenant, who levies the tax in
coin, Turkish money being the recognised medium of exchange
everywhere.&nbsp; Without pretending to anything at all like
accuracy we made a calculation that the Emir&rsquo;s revenue from
all sources of tribute and tax may amount to &pound;60,000
yearly, and that the annual passage of the pilgrimage through his
dominions may bring &pound;20,000 to &pound;30,000 more to his
exchequer.</p>
<p>With regard to his expenditure, it is perhaps easier to
calculate.&nbsp; He pays a small sum yearly in tribute to the
Sherif of Medina, partly as a religious offering, partly to
insure immunity for his outlying <a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>possessions, Kheybar, K&acirc;f and
the rest, from Turkish aggression.&nbsp; I should guess this
tribute to be &pound;3,000 to &pound;5,000, but could not
ascertain the amount.&nbsp; The Emir&rsquo;s expenditure on his
army can hardly be more, and with his civil list and every
expense of Government, should be included within
&pound;10,000.&nbsp; On his household he may spend &pound;5,000,
and on his stable &pound;1,000.&nbsp; By far the largest item in
his budget must be described as entertainment.&nbsp; Mohammed ibn
Rashid, in imitation of his predecessors, feeds daily two to
three hundred guests at the palace; the poor are there clothed,
and presents of camels and clothes made to richer strangers from
a distance.&nbsp; The meal consists of rice and camel meat,
sometimes mutton, and there is besides a constant
&ldquo;coulage&rdquo; in dates and coffee, which I cannot
estimate at less than &pound;50 a day, say &pound;20,000 yearly,
or with presents, &pound;25,000.&nbsp; Thus we have our budget
made up to about &pound;45,000 expenditure, as against
&pound;80,000 to &pound;90,000 revenue&mdash;which leaves a
handsome margin for wars and other accidents, and for that
amassing of treasure which is traditional with the Ibn
Rashids.&nbsp; I must say, however, once more, that I am merely
guessing my figures, and nobody, perhaps, in Jebel Shammar,
except the Emir himself and Ham&uacute;d, could do more.</p>
<p>It will be seen from all this that Jebel Shammar is,
financially, in a very flourishing state.&nbsp; The curse of
money-lending has not yet invaded it, and neither <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>prince nor
people are able to spend sixpence more than they have got.&nbsp;
No public works, requiring public expenditure and public loans,
have yet been undertaken, and it is difficult to imagine in what
they would consist.&nbsp; The digging of new wells is indeed the
only duty a &ldquo;company&rdquo; could find to execute, for
roads are unnecessary in a country all like a macadamised
highway; there are no rivers to make canals with, or suburban
populations to supply with tramways.&nbsp; One might predict with
confidence, that the secret of steam locomotion will have been
forgotten before ever a railway reaches Jebel Shammar.</p>
<p>With regard to the form of government, it is good mainly
because it is effective.&nbsp; It is no doubt discordant to
European ideas of political propriety, that the supreme power in
a country should be vested in Bedouin hands.&nbsp; But in Arabia
they are the only hands that can wield it.&nbsp; The town cannot
coerce the desert; therefore, if they are to live at peace, the
desert must coerce the town.&nbsp; The Turks, with all their
machinery of administration, and their power of wealth and
military force, have never been able to secure life and property
to travellers in the desert, and in Arabia have been powerless to
hold more than the towns.&nbsp; Even the pilgrim road from
Damascus, though nominally in their keeping, can only be
traversed by them with an army, and at considerable risk.&nbsp;
Ibn Rashid, on the other hand, by the mere effect of his will,
keeps <a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>all the desert in an absolute peace.&nbsp; In the whole
district of Jebel Shammar, embracing, as it does, some of the
wildest deserts, inhabited by some of the wildest people in the
world, a traveller may go unarmed and unescorted, without more
let or hindrance than if he were following a highway in
England.&nbsp; On every road of Jebel Shammar, townsmen may be
found jogging on donkey-back, alone, or on foot, carrying neither
gun nor lance, and with all their wealth about them.&nbsp; If you
ask about the dangers of the road, they will return the question,
&ldquo;Are we not here in Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s
country?&rdquo;&nbsp; No system, however perfect, of patrols and
forts and escorts, could produce a result like this.</p>
<p>In the town, on the other hand, the Bedouin prince, despotic
though he may be, is still under close restraint from public
opinion.&nbsp; The citizens of Jebel Shammar have not what we
should call constitutional rights; there is no machinery among
them for the assertion of their power; but there is probably no
community in the old world, where popular feeling exercises a
more powerful influence on government than it does at
Ha&iuml;l.&nbsp; The Emir, irresponsible as he is in individual
acts, knows well that he cannot transgress the traditional
unwritten law of Arabia with impunity.&nbsp; An unpopular sheykh
would cease, <i>ipso facto</i>, to be sheykh, for, though
dethroned by no public ceremony, and subjected to no personal
ill-treatment, he would find himself abandoned in favour of a
more acceptable member of his family.&nbsp; <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>The citizen
soldiers would not support a recognised tyrant in the town, nor
would the Bedouins outside.&nbsp; Princes in Arabia have,
therefore, to consider public opinion before all else.</p>
<p>The flaw in the system, for in every system there will be
found one, lies in the uncertainty of succession to the Sheykhat
or Bedouin throne.&nbsp; On the death of an Emir, if he have no
son of full age and acknowledged capacity to take up the reins of
government, rival claimants, brothers, uncles, or cousins of the
dead man, dispute his succession in arms, and many and bitter
have been the wars in consequence.&nbsp; Such, quite lately, was
the quarrel which convulsed Aared on the death of Feysul ibn
Saoud, and led to the disintegration of the Wahhabi monarchy, and
such, one cannot help fearing, may be the fate of Jebel Shammar,
on Mohammed&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He has no children, and the sons of
Tell&aacute;l, the next heirs to the throne, have a formidable
rival in Ham&uacute;d.&nbsp; The Emir, however, is a young man,
forty-five, and may live long; and if he should do so, seems to
have the succession of the Wahhabi monarchy in his hands.&nbsp;
He has effected, he and his predecessors, the union of all the
Bedouin sheykhs, from Meshhed Ali to Medina, under his
leadership, and is in close connection with those of Kasim and
Aared.&nbsp; His authority is established as far north as
K&acirc;f, and he has his eye already on the towns still further
north, if ever they should shake off the Turkish bondage.&nbsp; I
look forward to the day when the Roala too, <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>and the
Welled Ali, shall have entered into his alliance, possibly even
the Sebaa and Ibn Haddal; and though it is neither likely nor
desirable that the old Wahhabi Empire should be re-established on
its centralised basis, a confederation of the tribes of the north
may continue its best traditions.&nbsp; Hauran and the Leja, and
the Euphrates towns, were once tributary to the Ibn Saouds, and
may be again one day to the Ibn Rashids.&nbsp; This is looking
far afield, but not farther than Mohammed himself looks. <a

class="footnote">[18]</a>&nbsp; Midhat&rsquo;s reign at Damascus
lasted for twenty months, and is remarkable only for the
intrigues in which it was spent.&nbsp; It began with an <i>action
d&rsquo;&eacute;clat</i>, the subjugation of the independent
Druses of the Hauran, a prosperous and unoffending community whom
Midhat with the help of the Welled Ali reduced to ruin.&nbsp; The
rest of his time and resources were spent in an attempt to gain
for himself the rank and title of khedive, a scheme which ended
in his recall.&nbsp; Of improvements, material or administrative,
nothing at all has been heard, but it is worth recording that a
series of fires during his term of office burnt down great part
of the bazaars at Damascus, causing much loss of property, and
that their place has been taken by a boulevard.&nbsp; Midhat has
been now removed to Smyrna, where it is amusing to read the
following account of him:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Midhat Pasha</span>&mdash;September
28:&mdash;&lsquo;A private correspondent of the <i>Journal de
Gen&egrave;ve</i>, writing ten days ago from Smyrna, says that
Midhat Pasha, being convinced that he possessed the sympathy of
the inhabitants and could count on their active co-operation,
conceived a short time since vast schemes of improvement and
reform for the benefit of the province which he has been called
upon to administer.&nbsp; The first works he proposed to take in
hand were the drainage of the great marshes of Halka-Bournar (the
Baths of Diana of the ancients), the cleansing of the sewers of
Smyrna, and the removal of the filth which cumbers the streets,
pollutes the air, and, as an eminent physician has told him,
impairs the health of the city and threatens at no distant date
to breed a pestilence.&nbsp; He next proposed, at the instance of
a clever engineer Effendi, to repress the ravages of the river
Hermus, which in winter overflows its banks and does immense
damage in the plain of Menemen.&nbsp; Orders were given for the
execution of engineering works on a great scale which, it was
thought, would correct this evil and restore to agriculture a
vast extent of fertile, albeit at present unproductive,
land.&nbsp; Administrative reform was to be also seriously
undertaken.&nbsp; The police were to be re-organized, and order
and honesty enforced in the courts of justice.&nbsp; The scandal
of gendarmes being constrained, owing to the insufficiency of
their pay, to enter into an alliance, offensive and defensive,
with all the thieves and cut-throats of the city&mdash;the
disgrace of judges receiving bribes from rogues and other
evil-doers&mdash;were to be promptly put down.&nbsp; It was
ordered that every ca&iuml;macan, mudir, chief of police, and
president of tribunal, guilty either of malfeasance or robbery,
should be arrested and imprisoned.&nbsp; The municipalities were
to cease being the mere mouthpieces of the valis, and consider
solely the interests of their constituencies.&nbsp; The accounts
of functionaries who, with nominal salaries of 800 francs a year,
spend 10,000, were to be strictly investigated and their
malversations severely punished; and many other measures, equally
praiseworthy and desirable, were either projected or begun.&nbsp;
But energy and goodwill in a reformer&mdash;whether he be a
Midhat or a Hamid&mdash;are, unfortunately, not alone sufficient
to accomplish reforms.&nbsp; To drain marshes, embank rivers,
cleanse sewers, remove filth, pay magistrates and policemen,
procure honest collectors of revenue, much money is
necessary.&nbsp; How was it to be obtained?&nbsp; Not from the
revenues of the port or the province; these are sent regularly,
to the last centime, to Constantinople, for the needs of the
Government are urgent and admit of no delay.&nbsp; Midhat Pasha,
not knowing which way to turn, called a <i>medjeless</i>
(council), but the members were able neither to suggest a
solution of the difficulty nor to find any money.&nbsp; In this
emergency it occurred to the Governor that there existed at
Smyrna a branch of the Ottoman Bank, at the door of which are
always stationed two superb nizams in gorgeous uniforms, who give
it the appearance of a Government establishment.&nbsp; Why should
not the bank provide the needful?&nbsp; The idea commended itself
to the Pasha, and the manager was requested to call forthwith at
the Konak on urgent public business.&nbsp; When he arrived there
Midhat unfolded to him his plans of reform, and proved, with the
eloquence of a new convert, that the public works he had in view
could not fail to be an unspeakable benefit to the province and
restore its waning prosperity.&nbsp; Never, he assured the
wondering manager, could the bank have a finer opportunity of
making a splendid investment than this of lending the Government
a few million francs, to be strictly devoted to the purposes he
had explained.&nbsp; The projected schemes, moreover, were to be
so immediately profitable that the bank might reckon with the
most implicit confidence on receiving back, in the course of a
few years, both interest and principal.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
however, all these arguments were lost on M. Heintze, the
manager; and he had to explain to the Pasha that, although he,
personally, would have been delighted to advance him the millions
he required, his instructions allowed him no discretion.&nbsp; He
was there to do ordinary banking business, and collect certain
revenues which had been assigned to the bank by way of security;
but he had been strictly enjoined to make no loans whatever,
however promising and profitable they might appear.&nbsp; And
this was the end of Midhat Pasha&rsquo;s great schemes of public
improvement and administrative reform.&nbsp; In these
circumstances it would be the height of injustice to accuse him
of not having kept the promises which he made on entering office;
for nobody, not even a Turkish Governor-General, can be expected
to achieve impossibilities.</p>

<p><a name="footnote272"></a><a href="#citation272"
class="footnote">[272]</a>&nbsp; That Mohammed ibn Rashid does
not limit his ambition to Nejd has been very recently
proved.&nbsp; In the month of April last, 1880, he marched with
an army of 5000 men from Ha&iuml;l, passed up the Wady
Sirh&aacute;n, surprised Mohammed Dukhi ibn Smeyr in the Harra
and sacked his camp, and then went on to the Hauran.&nbsp; The
citizens of Damascus were not a little startled at learning one
morning that the Emir was at Bozra not 60 miles from the capital
of Syria, and there was much speculation as to his object in
coming so far northwards, no army from Nejd having been seen in
the Paahalik since the days of the Wahhabi Empire.&nbsp; Then it
was whispered that he had made friends with Ibn Smeyr, that the
quarrel between them had been a mistake, and that a Sherari
guide, held responsible for the blunder, had been beheaded;
lastly, that an enormous feast of reconciliation had been given
by Ibn Rashid to the Northern tribes, at which 75 camels and 600
sheep had been slaughtered, and that after a stay of some weeks
at Melakh the Emir had returned to Nejd.</p>
<p>Without pretending to know precisely what was in
Mohammed&rsquo;s mind in making this ghaz&uacute;, or all that
really happened, it seems to me not difficult to guess its main
object.&nbsp; Ibn Smeyr&rsquo;s success over Ibn Shaalan, already
alluded to, had placed him in a leading position with the tribes
of the North; and his raid against the Druses of the Hauran, a
district once tributary to the Emirs of Nejd, pointed him out for
Mohammed&rsquo;s resentment.&nbsp; It is part of the Ibn Rashid
policy to strike a blow and then make peace; and by thus humbling
their most successful chief, and becoming afterwards his host,
Mohammed achieved exactly that sort of reputation he most valued
with the Northern tribes.&nbsp; He has asserted himself as
supreme, where he chooses to be so, in the desert, and has
moreover reminded the frontier population in Syria of the old
Wahhabi pretensions to Eastern Syria.&nbsp; It is conceivable
that having coerced or persuaded the &Aacute;nazeh to join his
league, he may, in the coming break-up of the Ottoman Empire,
succeed to that part of its inheritance, and be recognised as
sovereign in all the lands beyond Jordan.</p>

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
